THOMAS STERNHOLD. _Circa_ 1549.
    The Lord descended from above
      And bow'd the heavens high;
    And underneath his feet he cast
      The darkness of the sky.
    On cherubs and on cherubims
      Full royally he rode;
    And on the wings of all the winds
      Came flying all abroad.

GEORGE PEELE. 1552-1598.
    His golden locks time hath to silver turned;
      O time too swift! Oh swiftness never ceasing!
    His youth 'gainst time and age hath ever spurned,
      But spurned in vain; youth waneth by encreasing.
_Sonnet. Polyhymnia._
    His helmet now shall make a hive for bees,

SIR WALTER RALEIGH. 1552-1618.
    If all the world and love were young,
    And truth in every shepherd's tongue,
    These pretty pleasures might me move
    To live with thee, and be thy love.
_The Nymph's Reply to the Passionate Shepherd._
    Fain would I, but I dare not; I dare, and yet I may not;
    I may, although I care not, for pleasure when I play not.
_Fain Would I._
    Passions are likened best to floods and streams:
    The shallow murmur, but the deep are dumb.
_The Silent Lover._
    Silence in love bewrays more woe
      Than words, though ne'er so witty:
    A beggar that is dumb, you know,
      May challenge double pity.
_The Silent Lover._
    Go, Soul, the body's guest,
      Upon a thankless arrant:
    Fear not to touch the best,
      The truth shall be thy warrant:
        Go, since I needs must die,
        And give the world the lie.
_The Lie._
    Methought I saw the grave where Laura lay.
_Verses to Edmund Spenser._
    Cowards [may] fear to die; but courage stout,
    Rather than live in snuff, will be put out.
_On the snuff of a candle the night before he died._--Raleigh's _Remains,
p. 258, ed. 1661._
    Even such is time, that takes in trust
    Our youth, our joys, our all we have,
    And pays us but with age and dust;
    Who in the dark and silent grave,
    When we have wandered all our ways,
    Shuts up the story of our days.
    But from this earth, this grave, this dust,
    My God shall raise me up, I trust!

     O eloquent, just, and mightie Death! whom none could advise, thou
     hast perswaded; what none hath dared, thou hast done; and whom
     all the world hath flattered, thou only hast cast out of the
     world and despised. Thou hast drawne together all the farre

     man, and covered it all over with these two narrow words, _Hic

     Of Law there can be no less acknowledged than that her seat is

    Cupid and my Campaspe play'd
    At cards for kisses: Cupid paid.
    He stakes his quiver, bow, and arrows,
    His mother's doves, and team of sparrows:
    Loses them too. Then down he throws
    The coral of his lip, the rose
    Growing on 's cheek (but none knows how);
    With these, the crystal of his brow,
    And then the dimple on his chin:
    All these did my Campaspe win.
    At last he set her both his eyes:
    She won, and Cupid blind did rise.
      O Love! has she done this to thee?
      What shall, alas! become of me?
_Cupid and Campaspe. Act iii. Sc. 5._

    In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
    To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
    And blown with restless violence round about
    The pendent world.
_Measure for Measure. Act iii. Sc. 1._

_A Midsummer Night's Dream. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    The lunatic, the lover, and the poet
    Are of imagination all compact:
    One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
    That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
    Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
    The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,
    Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
    And as imagination bodies forth
    The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
    Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing
    A local habitation and a name.
    Such tricks hath strong imagination,
    That if it would but apprehend some joy,
    It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
    Or in the night, imagining some fear,
    How easy is a bush supposed a bear!

     when you have them, they are not worth the search.
_The Merchant of Venice. Act i. Sc. 1._
    In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,

_The Merchant of Venice. Act i. Sc. 2._
     My meaning in saying he is a good man, is to have you understand
     me that he is sufficient.

    The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
    Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!

    The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
    It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
    Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest:
    It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
    'T is mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
    The throned monarch better than his crown;
    His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
    The attribute to awe and majesty,
    Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
    But mercy is above this sceptred sway,
    It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
    It is an attribute to God himself;
    And earthly power doth then show likest God's,
    When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
    Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
    That in the course of justice none of us
    Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
    And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
    The deeds of mercy.

    He is well paid that is well satisfied.
_The Merchant of Venice. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
    Here we will sit and let the sounds of music
    Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
    Become the touches of sweet harmony.
    Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
    Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:
    There 's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
    But in his motion like an angel sings,
    Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins.
    Such harmony is in immortal souls;
    But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
    Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
_The Merchant of Venice. Act v. Sc. 1._
    I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
_The Merchant of Venice. Act v. Sc. 1._
    The man that hath no music in himself,
    Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
    Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;
    The motions of his spirit are dull as night,
    And his affections dark as Erebus.
    Let no such man be trusted.
_The Merchant of Venice. Act v. Sc. 1._
    How far that little candle throws his beams!
    So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
_The Merchant of Venice. Act v. Sc. 1._
    How many things by season season'd are
    To their right praise and true perfection!
_The Merchant of Venice. Act v. Sc. 1._
    This night methinks is but the daylight sick.

    Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
    Of starved people.

    Fortune reigns in gifts of the world.
_As You Like It. Act i. Sc. 2._
     The little foolery that wise men have makes a great show.

    Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.
_As You Like It. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Your heart's desires be with you!
_As You Like It. Act i. Sc. 2._

_As You Like It. Act i. Sc. 3._
    Sweet are the uses of adversity,
    Which like the toad, ugly and venomous,
    Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
    And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
    Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
    Sermons in stones, and good in every thing.
_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 1._
                     The big round tears

    Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,

_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    For in my youth I never did apply
    Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood.
_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
    Frosty, but kindly.
_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    O, good old man, how well in thee appears
    The constant service of the antique world,
    When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
    Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
    Where none will sweat but for promotion.
_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 3._
     Ay, now am I in Arden: the more fool I. When I was at home I was

_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._
    And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,

_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._
    And then he drew a dial from his poke,
    And looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
    Says very wisely, "It is ten o'clock:
    Thus we may see," quoth he, "how the world wags."
_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._
    And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,
    And then from hour to hour we rot and rot;
    And thereby hangs a tale.
_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._
    My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
    That fools should be so deep-contemplative;
    And I did laugh sans intermission
    An hour by his dial.
_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._

_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._
                 If ladies be but young and fair,
    They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,
    Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
    After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
    With observation, the which he vents
    In mangled forms.
_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._
                         I must have liberty
    Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
    To blow on whom I please.
_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._
    The "why" is plain as way to parish church.
_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._
    Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
    Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time;
    If ever you have look'd on better days,
    If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
    If ever sat at any good man's feast.
_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._
    True is it that we have seen better days.
_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._
                           And wiped our eyes
    Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd.
_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._
    Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger.
_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._
                       All the world 's a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players.
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
    And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail
    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
    Sighing like furnace, with a woful ballad
    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
    Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard;
    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
    Seeking the bubble reputation
    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
    In fair round belly with good capon lined,
    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
    Full of wise saws and modern instances;
    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
    His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
    That ends this strange eventful history,
    Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
_As You Like It. Act ii. Sc. 7._
    Blow, blow, thou winter wind!
    Thou art not so unkind

_As You Like It. Act iii. Sc. 5._
     It is a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,
     extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation
     of my travels, in which my often rumination wraps me in a most
     humorous sadness.
_As You Like It. Act iv. Sc. 1._

    That come before the swallow dares, and take
    The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,
    But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
    Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses,
    That die unmarried, ere they can behold
    Bright Phoebus in his strength,--a malady
    Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
    The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
    The flower-de-luce being one.
_The Winter's Tale. Act iv. Sc. 4._
               When you do dance, I wish you
    A wave o' the sea,[78-2] that you might ever do

_King John. Act i. Sc. 1._
    For he is but a bastard to the time
    That doth not smack of observation.

    Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
    As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!
_King John. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words
    Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.
_King John. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    I will instruct my sorrows to be proud;
    For grief is proud, and makes his owner stoop.
_King John. Act iii. Sc. 1._
                        Here I and sorrows sit;
    Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.
_King John. Act iii. Sc. 1._
                Thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!
    Thou little valiant, great in villany!

    Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight
    But when her humorous ladyship is by
    To teach thee safety.

_King John. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
    Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,
    Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,
    Remembers me of all his gracious parts,

    Mocking the air with colours idly spread.
_King John. Act v. Sc. 1._
                   'T is strange that death should sing.
    I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,
    Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,
    And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
    His soul and body to their lasting rest.
_King John. Act v. Sc. 7._

    Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.
_King Richard II. Act i. Sc. 3._
    O, who can hold a fire in his hand
    By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
    Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
    By bare imagination of a feast?
    Or wallow naked in December snow
    By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?

_King Richard II. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle,
    This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
    This other Eden, demi-paradise,
    This fortress built by Nature for herself
    Against infection and the hand of war,
    This happy breed of men, this little world,
    This precious stone set in the silver sea,
    Which serves it in the office of a wall
    Or as a moat defensive to a house,
    Against the envy of less happier lands,
    This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.

_King Richard II. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    O, call back yesterday, bid time return!
_King Richard II. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Let 's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs.
_King Richard II. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    And nothing can we call our own but death
    And that small model of the barren earth
    Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
    For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
    And tell sad stories of the death of kings.

    Under whose colours he had fought so long.
_King Richard II. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    A mockery king of snow.
_King Richard II. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
    After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,
    Are idly bent on him that enters next,
    Thinking his prattle to be tedious.
_King Richard II. Act v. Sc. 2._
                          As for a camel
    To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.
_King Richard II. Act v. Sc. 5._
    So shaken as we are, so wan with care.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act i. Sc. 1._
                       In those holy fields
    Over whose acres walked those blessed feet
    Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
    For our advantage on the bitter cross.

     Thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeed able to corrupt a
     saint.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act i. Sc. 2._
     And now am I, if a man should speak truly, little better than one
     of the wicked.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act i. Sc. 2._
     'T is my vocation, Hal; 't is no sin for a man to labour in his
     vocation.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act i. Sc. 2._
    He will give the devil his due.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act i. Sc. 2._
     There 's neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act i. Sc. 2._
    If all the year were playing holidays,
    To sport would be as tedious as to work.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd
    Showed like a stubble-land at harvest-home;
    He was perfumed like a milliner,
    And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
    A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
    He gave his nose and took 't away again.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act i. Sc. 3._
    And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
    He called the untaught knaves, unmannerly,

    Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act i. Sc. 3._
    God save the mark.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act i. Sc. 3._
    And telling me, the sovereign'st thing on earth
    Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
    And that it was great pity, so it was,
    This villanous saltpetre should be digg'd
    Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
    Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
    So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
    He would himself have been a soldier.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act i. Sc. 3._
                              The blood more stirs
    To rouse a lion than to start a hare!
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act i. Sc. 3._
    By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap
    To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,
    Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
    Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,
    And pluck up drowned honour by the locks.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act i. Sc. 3._
    I know a trick worth two of that.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act ii. Sc. 1._
     If the rascal have not given me medicines to make me love him, I
     'll be hanged.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act ii. Sc. 2._
     It would be argument for a week, laughter for a month, and a good
     jest for ever.

     There live not three good men unhanged in England; and one of
     them is fat and grows old.

    I am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act ii. Sc. 4._
     I have peppered two of them: two I am sure I have paid, two
     rogues in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a
     lie, spit in my face; call me horse. Thou knowest my old ward:
     here I lay, and thus I bore my point. Four rogues in buckram let
     drive at  me

    Three misbegotten knaves in Kendal green.

    All plumed like estridges that with the wind
    Baited like eagles having lately bathed;
    Glittering in golden coats, like images;
    As full of spirit as the month of May,
    And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,
    His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd,
    Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,
    And vaulted with such ease into his seat
    As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,
    To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
    And witch the world with noble horsemanship.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    The cankers of a calm world and a long peace.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act iv. Sc. 2._
     A mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the
     gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye hath seen such
     scarecrows. I 'll not march through Coventry with them, that 's
     flat: nay, and the villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if
     they had gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of
     prison. There 's but a shirt and a half in all my company; and
     the half-shirt is two napkins tacked together and thrown over the
     shoulders like an herald's coat without sleeves.

_King Henry IV. Part I. Act v. Sc. 1._
     Honour pricks me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I
     come on,--how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or an arm? no:
     or take away the grief of a wound? no. Honour hath no skill in
     surgery, then? no. What is honour? a word. What is in that word
     honour; what is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?
     he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no. Doth he hear it?
     no. 'T is insensible, then? yea, to the dead. But will it not
     live with the living? no. Why? detraction will not suffer it.
     Therefore I 'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon. And so
     ends my catechism.

              Full bravely hast thou fleshed
    Thy maiden sword.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act v. Sc. 4._
     Lord, Lord, how this world is given to lying! I grant you I was
     down and out of breath; and so was he. But we rose both at an
     instant, and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act v. Sc. 4._
    I 'll purge, and leave sack, and live cleanly.
_King Henry IV. Part I. Act v. Sc. 4._
    Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,
    So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,
    Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,
    And would have told him half his Troy was burnt.
_King Henry IV. Part II. Act i. Sc. 1._
    Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
    Hath but a losing office, and his tongue
    Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,
    Remember'd tolling a departing friend.

     good thing to make it too common.

_King Henry IV. Part II. Act i. Sc. 2._
                  When we mean to build,
    We first survey the plot, then draw the model;
    And when we see the figure of the house,
    Then must we rate the cost of the erection.
_King Henry IV. Part II. Act i. Sc. 3._
    An habitation giddy and unsure
    Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.

     Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my
     Dolphin-chamber, at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, upon
     Wednesday in Wheeson week.
_King Henry IV. Part II. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    I do now remember the poor creature, small beer.
_King Henry IV. Part II. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    Let the end try the man.
_King Henry IV. Part II. Act ii. Sc. 2._
     Thus we play the fools with the time, and the spirits of the wise
     sit in the clouds and mock us.
_King Henry IV. Part II. Act ii. Sc. 2._
                He was indeed the glass
    Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves.

    Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more,

    The hum of either army stilly sounds,
    That the fixed sentinels almost receive
    The secret whispers of each other's watch;
    Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
    Each battle sees the other's umbered face;
    Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs
    Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents
    The armourers, accomplishing the knights,
    With busy hammers closing rivets up,
    Give dreadful note of preparation.

    Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;
    Between two blades, which bears the better temper;
    Between two horses, which doth bear him best;
    Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye,
    I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment;
    But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,
    Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.

_King Henry VI. Part II. Act iv. Sc. 2._
     Is not this a lamentable thing, that of the skin of an innocent
     lamb should be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled
     o'er, should undo a man?
_King Henry VI. Part II. Act iv. Sc. 2._
     Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house, and the bricks are
     alive at this day to testify it.
_King Henry VI. Part II. Act iv. Sc. 2._
     Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in
     erecting a grammar-school; and whereas, before, our forefathers
     had no other books but the score and the tally, thou hast caused
     printing to be used, and, contrary to the king, his crown and
     dignity, thou hast built a paper-mill.
_King Henry VI. Part II. Act iv. Sc. 7._
    How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown,
    Within whose circuit is Elysium

_King Henry VI. Part III. Act ii. Sc. 2._
                               Warwick, peace,
    Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
_King Henry VI. Part III. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    A little fire is quickly trodden out;
    Which, being suffered, rivers cannot quench.
_King Henry VI. Part III. Act iv. Sc. 8._
    Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;
    The thief doth fear each bush an officer.
_King Henry VI. Part III. Act v. Sc. 6._
    Now is the winter of our discontent
    Made glorious summer by this sun of York,
    And all the clouds that loured upon our house
    In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
    Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,
    Our bruised arms hung up for monuments,
    Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
    Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
    Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front;
    And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds
    To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
    He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
    To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
    But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
    Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
    I, that am rudely stamped, and want love's majesty
    To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
    I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion,
    Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
    Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time
    Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
    And that so lamely and unfashionable
    That dogs bark at me as I halt by them,
    Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
    Have no delight to pass away the time,
    Unless to spy my shadow in the sun.
_King Richard III. Act i. Sc. 1._
    To leave this keen encounter of our wits.

                The world is grown so bad,
    That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.
_King Richard III. Act i. Sc. 3._
    And thus I clothe my naked villany
    With old odd ends stolen out of[96-2] holy writ,
    And seem a saint when most I play the devil.
_King Richard III. Act i. Sc. 3._
    O, I have passed a miserable night,
    So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
    That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
    I would not spend another such a night,
    Though 't were to buy a world of happy days.
_King Richard III. Act i. Sc. 4._
    Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
    What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
    What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
    Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks,
    Ten thousand men that fishes gnawed upon,
    Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
    Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
    All scattered in the bottom of the sea:
    Some lay in dead men's skulls; and in those holes
    Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
    As 't were in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems.
_King Richard III. Act i. Sc. 4._
    A parlous boy.
_King Richard III. Act ii. Sc. 4._

_King Henry VIII. Act ii. Sc. 2._
         'T is better to be lowly born,
    And range with humble livers in content,
    Than to be perked up in a glistering grief,
    And wear a golden sorrow.
_King Henry VIII. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    Orpheus with his lute made trees,
    And the mountain-tops that freeze,

    And yet words are no deeds.
_King Henry VIII. Act iii. Sc. 2._
                   And then to breakfast with
    What appetite you have.
_King Henry VIII. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    I have touched the highest point of all my greatness;
    And from that full meridian of my glory
    I haste now to my setting: I shall fall
    Like a bright exhalation in the evening,
    And no man see me more.
_King Henry VIII. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Press not a falling man too far!
_King Henry VIII. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!
    This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
    The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,
    And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
    The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
    And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
    His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
    And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,
    Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
    This many summers in a sea of glory,
    But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride
    At length broke under me and now has left me,
    Weary and old with service, to the mercy
    Of a rude stream, that must forever hide me.
    Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:
    I feel my heart new opened. O, how wretched
    Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
    There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
    That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,
    More pangs and fears than wars or women have:
    And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
    Never to hope again.
_King Henry VIII. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    A peace above all earthly dignities,
    A still and quiet conscience.

    Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,
    And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,
    Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;
    A sure and safe one, though thy master missed it.
_King Henry VIII. Act iii. Sc. 2._
      I charge thee, fling away ambition:
    By that sin fell the angels.
_King Henry VIII. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;
    Corruption wins not more than honesty.
    Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,
    To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:
    Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,
    Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,
    Thou fall'st a blessed martyr!
_King Henry VIII. Act iii. Sc. 2._

_King Henry VIII. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    An old man, broken with the storms of state,

_King Henry VIII. Act iv. Sc. 2._
    He gave his honours to the world again,
    His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.
_King Henry VIII. Act iv. Sc. 2._
    So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!
_King Henry VIII. Act iv. Sc. 2._
                     He was a man
    Of an unbounded stomach.
_King Henry VIII. Act iv. Sc. 2._
    Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues
    We write in water.
_King Henry VIII. Act iv. Sc. 2._
    He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;
    Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading;
    Lofty and sour to them that loved him not,
    But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.
_King Henry VIII. Act iv. Sc. 2._
                Yet in bestowing, madam,

_King Henry VIII. Act iv. Sc. 2._
    After my death I wish no other herald,
    No other speaker of my living actions,

    To hear such flattery now, and in my presence.
_King Henry VIII. Act v. Sc. 3._

    A most unspotted lily shall she pass
    To the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.

    The common curse of mankind,--folly and ignorance.
_Troilus and Cressida. Act ii. Sc. 3._
     All lovers swear more performance than they are able, and yet
     reserve an ability that they never perform; vowing more than the
     perfection of ten, and discharging less than the tenth part of
     one.

                   Welcome ever smiles,
    And farewell goes out sighing.
_Troilus and Cressida. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.
_Troilus and Cressida. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    And give to dust that is a little gilt
    More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.
_Troilus and Cressida. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    And like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,
    Be shook to air.
_Troilus and Cressida. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    His heart and hand both open and both free;
    For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;
    Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty.
_Troilus and Cressida. Act iv. Sc. 5._
                    The end crowns all,
    And that old common arbitrator, Time,
    Will one day end it.
_Troilus and Cressida. Act iv. Sc. 5._
     Had I a dozen sons, each in my love alike and none less dear than
     thine and my good Marcius, I had rather eleven die nobly for
     their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
_Coriolanus. Act i. Sc. 3._
    Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
_Coriolanus. Act ii. Sc. 1._
     A cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in 't.

    Many-headed multitude.
_Coriolanus. Act ii. Sc. 3._
          I thank you for your voices: thank you:
    Your most sweet voices.
_Coriolanus. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark you
    His absolute "shall"?
_Coriolanus. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    Enough, with over-measure.
_Coriolanus. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    His nature is too noble for the world:
    He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
    Or Jove for 's power to thunder.
_Coriolanus. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    That it shall hold companionship in peace
    With honour, as in war.
_Coriolanus. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    _Serv._ Where dwellest thou?
    _Cor._ Under the canopy.
_Coriolanus. Act iv. Sc. 5._
    A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
    And harsh in sound to thine.
_Coriolanus. Act iv. Sc. 5._
                 Chaste as the icicle
    That 's curdied by the frost from purest snow
    And hangs on Dian's temple.
_Coriolanus. Act v. Sc. 3._
    If you have writ your annals true, 't is there
    That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
    Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
    Alone I did it. Boy!
_Coriolanus. Act v. Sc. 6._
    Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge.
_Titus Andronicus. Act i. Sc. 2._
    She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;
    She is a woman, therefore may be won;
    She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.
    What, man! more water glideth by the mill
    Than wots the miller of;[104-1] and easy it is
    Of a cut loaf to steal a shive.
_Titus Andronicus. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    The eagle suffers little birds to sing.
_Titus Andronicus. Act iv. Sc. 4._
    The weakest goes to the wall.

    Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 1._
          An hour before the worshipp'd sun
    Peered forth the golden window of the east.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 1._
    As is the bud bit with an envious worm
    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 1._
    Saint-seducing gold.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 1._
    He that is strucken blind cannot forget
    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 1._
          One fire burns out another's burning,
    One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    That book in many's eyes doth share the glory
    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 3._
    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 4._
    O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you!
    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
    In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
    On the fore-finger of an alderman,
    Drawn with a team of little atomies
    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 4._
    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 4._
    Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
    Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
    And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
    And sleeps again.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 4._
                   True, I talk of dreams,
    Which are the children of an idle brain,
    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 4._
    For you and I are past our dancing days.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 5._
    It seems she hangs[105-2] upon the cheek of night
    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 5._
    Shall have the chinks.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 5._
    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
_Romeo and Juliet. Act i. Sc. 5._
    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
    When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid!
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
    But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
    It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
    O that I were a glove upon that hand,
    That I might touch that cheek!
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    What 's in a name? That which we call a rose
    By any other name would smell as sweet.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    For stony limits cannot hold love out.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
    Than twenty of their swords.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
                At lovers' perjuries,
    They say, Jove laughs.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    _Rom._ Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops
    _Jul._ O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
    That monthly changes in her circled orb,
    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    The god of my idolatry.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
    Ere one can say, "It lightens."
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
    May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
    Like softest music to attending ears!
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow,
    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
    In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
    For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
    But to the earth some special good doth give,
    Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
    Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
    And vice sometimes by action dignified.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
    And where care lodges, sleep will never lie.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    Stabbed with a white wench's black eye.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 4._
    The courageous captain of complements.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 4._
    One, two, and the third in your bosom.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 4._
    O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified!
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 4._
    I am the very pink of courtesy.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 4._
     A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will
     speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 4._
    My man 's as true as steel.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 4._
    These violent delights have violent ends.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 6._
    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 6._
    Here comes the lady! O, so light a foot
    Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act ii. Sc. 6._
     Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    A word and a blow.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    A plague o' both your houses!
_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 1._
     _Rom._ Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
     _Mer._ No, 't is not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
     church-door; but 't is enough, 't will serve.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 1._
                     When he shall die,
    Take him and cut him out in little stars,
    And he will make the face of heaven so fine
    That all the world will be in love with night,
    And pay no worship to the garish sun.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Was ever book containing such vile matter
    So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
    In such a gorgeous palace!
_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 3._
                             They may seize
    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
    Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    The damned use that word in hell.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain-tops.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 5._
    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 5._
                        All these woes shall serve
    For sweet discourses in our time to come.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 5._
    Villain and he be many miles asunder.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 5._
    Thank me no thanks, nor proud me no prouds.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act iii. Sc. 5._
    Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act iv. Sc. 2._
    My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act v. Sc. 1._
    I do remember an apothecary,
    And hereabouts he dwells.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act v. Sc. 1._
                      Meagre were his looks,
    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act v. Sc. 1._
    A beggarly account of empty boxes.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act v. Sc. 1._
    Famine is in thy cheeks.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act v. Sc. 1._
    The world is not thy friend nor the world's law.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act v. Sc. 1._
    _Ap._ My poverty, but not my will, consents.
    _Rom._ I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act v. Sc. 1._
                  The strength
    Of twenty men.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act v. Sc. 1._
    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book.
_Romeo and Juliet. Act v. Sc. 3._
                         Her beauty makes
    This vault a feasting presence full of light.
_Romeo and Juliet, Act v. Sc. 3._
                      Beauty's ensign yet
    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
_Romeo and Juliet, Act v. Sc. 3._
                  Eyes, look your last!
    Arms, take your last embrace!
_Romeo and Juliet, Act v. Sc. 3._
    But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,
    Leaving no tract behind.
_Timon of Athens. Act i. Sc. 1._
     Here 's that which is too weak to be a sinner,--honest water,
     which ne'er left man i' the mire.
_Timon of Athens. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;
    I pray for no man but myself;
    Grant I may never prove so fond,
    To trust man on his oath or bond.
_Timon of Athens. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Men shut their doors against a setting sun.
_Timon of Athens. Act i. Sc. 2._
                                Every room
    Hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy.
_Timon of Athens. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    'T is lack of kindly warmth.
_Timon of Athens. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    Every man has his fault, and honesty is his.
_Timon of Athens. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.
_Timon of Athens. Act iii. Sc. 5._
    We have seen better days.
_Timon of Athens. Act iv. Sc. 2._
    Are not within the leaf of pity writ.
_Timon of Athens. Act iv. Sc. 3._
          I 'll example you with thievery:
    The sun 's a thief, and with his great attraction
    Robs the vast sea; the moon 's an arrant thief,
    And her pale fire she snatches from the sun;
    The sea 's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
    The moon into salt tears; the earth 's a thief,
    That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
    From general excrement: each thing 's a thief.
_Timon of Athens. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    Life's uncertain voyage.
_Timon of Athens. Act v. Sc. 1._
    As proper men as ever trod upon neat's leather.
_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 1._
    The live-long day.
_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 1._
    Beware the ides of March.
_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Well, honour is the subject of my story.
    I cannot tell what you and other men
    Think of this life; but, for my single self,
    I had as lief not be as live to be
    In awe of such a thing as I myself.
_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._
                         "Darest thou, Cassius, now
    Leap in with me into this angry flood,
    And swim to yonder point?" Upon the word,
    Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
    And bade him follow.
_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Help me, Cassius, or I sink!
_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._
          Ye gods, it doth amaze me
    A man of such a feeble temper should
    So get the start of the majestic world
    And bear the palm alone.
_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
    Like a Colossus, and we petty men
    Walk under his huge legs and peep about
    To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
    Men at some time are masters of their fates:
    The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
    But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._
                         Conjure with 'em,
    Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Cæsar.
    Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
    Upon what meat doth this our Cæsar feed,
    That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
    Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._
    There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
    The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
    As easily as a king.
_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Let me have men about me that are fat,
    Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights:
    Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
    He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.
_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._
                        He reads much;
    He is a great observer, and he looks
    Quite through the deeds of men.
_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
    As if he mock'd himself, and scorn'd his spirit
    That could be moved to smile at anything.
_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._
    But, for my own part, it was Greek to me.
_Julius Cæsar. Act i. Sc. 2._
                        'T is a common proof,
    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
    But when he once attains the upmost[111-1] round,
    He then unto the ladder turns his back,
    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
    By which he did ascend.
_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    Between the acting of a dreadful thing
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:
    The Genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council; and the state of man,
    Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection.
_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    A dish fit for the gods.
_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
    He says he does, being then most flattered.
_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;
    Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
    Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
    Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
    Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 1._
      With an angry wafture of your hand,
    Gave sign for me to leave you.
_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    You are my true and honourable wife,
    As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
    That visit my sad heart.
_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
    Being so father'd and so husbanded?
_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,
    In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
    Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol.
_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 2._
            These things are beyond all use,
    And I do fear them.
_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
    The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    Cowards die many times before their deaths;
    The valiant never taste of death but once.
    Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
    It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
    Seeing that death, a necessary end,
    Will come when it will come.
_Julius Cæsar. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    _Cæs._ The ides of March are come.
    _Sooth._ Ay, Cæsar; but not gone.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    But I am constant as the northern star,
    Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality
    There is no fellow in the firmament.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    Et tu, Brute!
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 1._
                  How many ages hence
    Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
    In states unborn and accents yet unknown!
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    The choice and master spirits of this age.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    Though last, not least in love.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
    That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
    Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
    That ever lived in the tide of times.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    Cry "Havoc," and let slip the dogs of war.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 1._
     Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my cause, and be
     silent that you may hear.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._
     Not that I loved Cæsar less, but that I loved Rome more.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Who is here so base that would be a bondman?
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._
     If any, speak; for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
    I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him.
    The evil that men do lives after them;
    The good is oft interred with their bones.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    For Brutus is an honourable man;
    So are they all, all honourable men.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept:
    Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
    And men have lost their reason.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    But yesterday the word of Cæsar might
    Have stood against the world; now lies he there,
    And none so poor to do him reverence.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    See what a rent the envious Casca made.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    This was the most unkindest cut of all.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._
                              Great Cæsar fell.
    O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
    Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
    Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    What private griefs they have, alas, I know not.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
    I am no orator, as Brutus is;
    But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    I only speak right on.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._
                       Put a tongue
    In every wound of Cæsar that should move
    The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    When love begins to sicken and decay,
    It useth an enforced ceremony.
    There are no tricks in plain and simple faith.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 2._
                            You yourself
    Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    The foremost man of all this world.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
    Than such a Roman.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    I said, an elder soldier, not a better:
    Did I say "better"?
_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
    For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
    That they pass by me as the idle wind,
    Which I respect not.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
    When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
    To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
    Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts:
    Dash him to pieces!
_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
    But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._
                         All his faults observed,
    Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    There is a tide in the affairs of men
    Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
    Omitted, all the voyage of their life
    Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._
      We must take the current when it serves,
    Or lose our ventures.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
    And nature must obey necessity.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    _Brutus._ Then I shall see thee again?
    _Ghost._ Ay, at Philippi.
    _Brutus._ Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.
_Julius Cæsar. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
    And leave them honeyless.
_Julius Cæsar. Act v. Sc. 1._
    Forever, and forever, farewell, Cassius!
    If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
    If not, why then this parting was well made.
_Julius Cæsar. Act v. Sc. 1._
          O, that a man might know
    The end of this day's business ere it come!
_Julius Cæsar. Act v. Sc. 1._
    The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
_Julius Cæsar. Act v. Sc. 3._
    This was the noblest Roman of them all.
_Julius Cæsar. Act v. Sc. 5._
    His life was gentle, and the elements
    So mix'd in him, that Nature might stand up
    And say to all the world, "This was a man!"
_Julius Cæsar. Act v. Sc. 5._
    _1 W._ When shall we three meet again
                In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
    _2 W._ When the hurlyburly 's done,
                When the battle 's lost and won.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 1._
    Fair is foul, and foul is fair.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 1._
    Banners flout the sky.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Sleep shall neither night nor day
    Hang upon his pent-house lid.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._
    Dwindle, peak, and pine.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._
                        What are these
    So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
    That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
    And yet are on 't?
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._
    If you can look into the seeds of time,
    And say which grain will grow and which will not.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._
    Stands not within the prospect of belief.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._
    The earth hath bubbles as the water has,
    And these are of them.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._
                        The insane root
    That takes the reason prisoner.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._
    And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
    The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
    Win us with honest trifles, to betray 's
    In deepest consequence.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._
                       Two truths are told,
    As happy prologues to the swelling act
    Of the imperial theme.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._
    And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
    Against the use of nature. Present fears
    Are less than horrible imaginings.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._
                           Nothing is
    But what is not.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._
    If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._
                  Come what come may,
    Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 3._
                  Nothing in his life
    Became him like the leaving it; he died
    As one that had been studied in his death
    To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
    As 't were a careless trifle.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 4._
                      There 's no art
    To find the mind's construction in the face.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 4._
    More is thy due than more than all can pay.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 4._
                    Yet do I fear thy nature;
    It is too full o' the milk of human kindness.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 5._
                       What thou wouldst highly,
    That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
    And yet wouldst wrongly win.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 5._
    That no compunctious visitings of nature
    Shake my fell purpose.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 5._
    Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
    May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
    Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
    Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
    But be the serpent under 't.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 5._
    Which shall to all our nights and days to come
    Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 5._
    This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
    Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
    Unto our gentle senses.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 6._
                   The heaven's breath
    Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
    Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
    Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:
    Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,
    The air is delicate.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 6._
    If it were done when 't is done, then 't were well
    It were done quickly: if the assassination
    Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
    With his surcease success; that but this blow
    Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
    But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
    We 'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
    We still have judgment here; that we but teach
    Bloody instructions, which being taught, return
    To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
    Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
    To our own lips.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 7._
                        Besides, this Duncan
    Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
    So clear in his great office, that his virtues
    Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
    The deep damnation of his taking-off;
    And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
    Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed
    Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
    Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
    That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
    To prick the sides of my intent, but only
    Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself,
    And falls on the other.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 7._
                              I have bought
    Golden opinions from all sorts of people.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 7._
    Letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would,"
    Like the poor cat i' the adage.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 7._
    I dare do all that may become a man;
    Who dares do more is none.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 7._
                          Nor time nor place
    Did then adhere.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 7._
    _Macb._ If we should fail?
    _Lady M._                  We fail!
    But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
    And we 'll not fail.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 7._
    Memory, the warder of the brain.
_Macbeth. Act i. Sc. 7._
                 There 's husbandry in heaven;
    Their candles are all out.
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 1._
                               Shut up
    In measureless content.
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    Is this a dagger which I see before me,
    The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
    I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
    Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
    To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
    A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
    Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going.
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 1._
                 Now o'er the one half-world
    Nature seems dead.
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 1._
                Thou sure and firm-set earth,
    Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
    Thy very stones prate of my whereabout.
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 1._
                     The bell invites me.
    Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
    That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
    Which gives the stern'st good-night.
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 2._
                The attempt and not the deed
    Confounds us.
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    I had most need of blessing, and "Amen"
    Stuck in my throat.
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    Methought I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more!
    Macbeth does murder sleep!" the innocent sleep,
    Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleave of care,
    The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
    Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
    Chief nourisher in life's feast.
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    Infirm of purpose!
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 2._
                      'T is the eye of childhood
    That fears a painted devil.
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
    Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
    The multitudinous seas incarnadine,
    Making the green one red.
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    The labour we delight in physics pain.
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 3._
      Dire combustion and confused events
    New hatch'd to the woful time.
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 3._
                        Tongue nor heart
    Cannot conceive nor name thee!
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
    Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
    The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
    The life o' the building!
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
    Is left this vault to brag of.
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
    Loyal and neutral, in a moment?
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    There 's daggers in men's smiles.
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    A falcon, towering in her pride of place,
    Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 4._
    Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up
    Thine own life's means!
_Macbeth. Act ii. Sc. 4._
    I must become a borrower of the night
    For a dark hour or twain.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    Let every man be master of his time
    Till seven at night.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
    Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
    No son of mine succeeding.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    _Mur._         We are men, my liege.
    _Mac._ Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 1._
                            I am one, my liege,
    Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
    Have so incensed that I am reckless what
    I do to spite the world.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,
    That I would set my life on any chance,
    To mend it, or be rid on 't.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 1._
              Things without all remedy
    Should be without regard; what 's done is done.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 2._
               Better be with the dead,
    Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
    Than on the torture of the mind to lie
    In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
    After life's fitful fever he sleeps well:
    Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,
    Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
    Can touch him further.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    In them Nature's copy 's not eterne.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    A deed of dreadful note.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
    Till thou applaud the deed.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Now spurs the lated traveller apace
    To gain the timely inn.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in
    To saucy doubts and fears.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
    And health on both!
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    Thou canst not say I did it; never shake
    Thy gory locks at me.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    The air-drawn dagger.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                     The time has been,
    That when the brains were out the man would die,
    And there an end; but now they rise again,
    With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
    And push us from our stools.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    I drink to the general joy o' the whole table.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
    Which thou dost glare with!
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                A thing of custom,--'t is no other;
    Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                What man dare, I dare:
    Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
    The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger,
    Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
    Shall never tremble.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                  Hence, horrible shadow!
    Unreal mockery, hence!
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    You have displac'd the mirth, broke the good meeting,
    With most admir'd disorder.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                Can such things be,
    And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
    Without our special wonder?
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    Stand not upon the order of your going,
    But go at once.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    _Macb._             What is the night?
    _L. Macb._ Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                              I am in blood
    Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,
    Returning were as tedious as go o'er.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                         My little spirit, see,
    Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.
_Macbeth. Act iii. Sc. 5._
    Double, double toil and trouble;
    Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    Eye of newt and toe of frog,
    Wool of bat and tongue of dog.
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    By the pricking of my thumbs,
    Something wicked this way comes.
          Open, locks,
          Whoever knocks!
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    A deed without a name.
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._
          I 'll make assurance double sure,
    And take a bond of fate.
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
    Come like shadows, so depart!
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    I 'll charm the air to give a sound,
    While you perform your antic round.
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    The weird sisters.
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    The flighty purpose never is o'ertook,
    Unless the deed go with it.
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 1._
                   When our actions do not,
    Our fears do make us traitors.
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 2._
    Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
    Uproar the universal peace, confound
    All unity on earth.
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    Stands Scotland where it did?
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak
    Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
    At one fell swoop?
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    I cannot but remember such things were,
    That were most precious to me.
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
    And braggart with my tongue.
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    The night is long that never finds the day.
_Macbeth. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    Out, damned spot! out, I say!
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 1._
    Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard?
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 1._
     Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood
     in him?
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 1._
     All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 1._
    Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,
    I cannot taint with fear.
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 3._
                      My way of life
    Is fall'n into the sere, the yellow leaf;
    And that which should accompany old age,
    As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
    I must not look to have; but in their stead
    Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
    Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 3._
    _Doct._            Not so sick, my lord,
    As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,
    That keep her from her rest.
    _Macb._                        Cure her of that.
    Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas'd,
    Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
    Raze out the written troubles of the brain,
    And with some sweet oblivious antidote
    Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
    Which weighs upon the heart?
    _Doct._                      Therein the patient
    Must minister to himself.
    _Macb._ Throw physic to the dogs: I 'll none of it.
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 3._
    I would applaud thee to the very echo,
    That should applaud again.
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 3._
    Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
    The cry is still, "They come!" our castle's strength
    Will laugh a siege to scorn.
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 5._
                            My fell of hair
    Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
    As life were in 't: I have supp'd full with horrors.
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 5._
    To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
    To the last syllable of recorded time,
    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
    The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
    Life 's but a walking shadow, a poor player
    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
    And then is heard no more: it is a tale
    Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
    Signifying nothing.
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 5._
    I pull in resolution, and begin
    To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
    That lies like truth: "Fear not, till Birnam wood
    Do come to Dunsinane."
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 5._
    I gin to be aweary of the sun.
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 5._
                   Blow, wind! come, wrack!
    At least we 'll die with harness on our back.
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 5._
    Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 6._
    I bear a charmed life.
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 8._
    And be these juggling fiends no more believ'd,
    That palter with us in a double sense:
    That keep the word of promise to our ear
    And break it to our hope.
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 8._
    Live to be the show and gaze o' the time.
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 8._
                      Lay on, Macduff,
    And damn'd be him that first cries, "Hold, enough!"
_Macbeth. Act v. Sc. 8._
    For this relief much thanks: 't is bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 1._
    But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 1._
                             Whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 1._
                              This sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 1._
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 1._
    And then it started like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 1._
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    The extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 1._
    It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
    And then, they say, no spirit dares stir[127-1] abroad;
    The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 1._
    So have I heard, and do in part believe it.
    But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 1._
    The memory be green.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    The head is not more native to the heart.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    A little more than kin, and less than kind.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
                 All that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Seems, madam! nay, it is; I know not "seems."
    'T is not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    But I have that within which passeth show;
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
                     'T is a fault to Heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    O, that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    That it should come to this!
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
                  Why, she would hang on him,
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Frailty, thy name is woman!
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    A little month.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Like Niobe, all tears.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    A beast, that wants discourse of reason.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    It is not nor it cannot come to good.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    In my mind's eye, Horatio.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    He was a man, take him for all in all,
    I shall not look upon his like again.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Season your admiration for a while.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    In the dead vast and middle of the night.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Arm'd at point exactly, cap-a-pe.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    _Ham._ His beard was grizzled,--no?
    _Hor._ It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Let it be tenable in your silence still.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Gave it an understanding, but no tongue.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
                   Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 2._
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
    Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._
    Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
    And recks not his own rede.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._
    Give thy thoughts no tongue.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them to thy soul with hoops[129-2] of steel.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._
                                 Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
    Bear 't that the opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all: to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._
    Springes to catch woodcocks.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._
    Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 3._
    _Ham._ The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
    _Hor._ It is a nipping and an eager air.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 4._
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honoured in the breach than the observance.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 4._
    Angels and ministers of grace, defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou comest in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee: I 'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
    Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous,[131-1] and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 4._
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 4._
                     My fate cries out,
    And makes each petty artery in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 4._
                     Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I 'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 4._
    Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 4._
                   I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
    I could a tale unfold, whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part
    And each particular hair to stand an end,
    Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That roots itself[131-4] in ease on Lethe wharf.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._
                     O my prophetic soul!
    My uncle!
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._
    But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhousell'd, disappointed, unaneled,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._
                           Leave her to heaven
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
    To prick and sting her.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._
    The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
    And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._
                 While memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I 'll wipe away all trivial fond records.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._
    Within the book and volume of my brain.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain:
    At least I 'm sure it may be so in Denmark.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._
    _Ham._ There 's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he 's an arrant knave.
    _Hor._ There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._
        Every man has business and desire,
    Such as it is.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._
               Art thou there, truepenny?
    Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._
    O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._
    Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._
    The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
    That ever I was born to set it right!
_Hamlet. Act i. Sc. 5._
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    This is the very ecstasy of love.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    Brevity is the soul of wit.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    More matter, with less art.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    That he is mad, 't is true: 't is true 't is pity;
    And pity 't is 't is true.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
            Find out the cause of this effect,
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    Doubt thou the stars are fire;
      Doubt that the sun doth move;
    Doubt truth to be a liar;
      But never doubt I love.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
     To be honest as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of
     ten thousand.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    Still harping on my daughter.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    _Pol._ What do you read, my lord?
    _Ham._ Words, words, words.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    They have a plentiful lack of wit.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    Though this be madness, yet there is method in 't.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
     There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    A dream itself is but a shadow.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
     Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
     This goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory;
     this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
     o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden
     fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and
     pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man!
     how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and moving
     how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in
     apprehension how like a god!
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    Man delights not me: no, nor woman neither.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
     There is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could
     find it out.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    I know a hawk from a handsaw.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
     O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    One fair daughter and no more,
    The which he loved passing well.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    Come, give us a taste of your quality.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
     The play, I remember, pleased not the million; 't was caviare to
     the general.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
     They are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time: after
     your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill
     report while you live.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
     Use every man after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    What 's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her?
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
                   Unpack my heart with words,
    And fall a-cursing, like a very drab.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
                 The devil hath power
    To assume a pleasing shape.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    Abuses me to damn me.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
                      The play 's the thing
    Wherein I 'll catch the conscience of the king.
_Hamlet. Act ii. Sc. 2._
                      With devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The devil himself.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._
      To be, or not to be: that is the question:
    Whether 't is nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep:
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to,--'t is a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
    To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there 's the rub:
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause: there 's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life;
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office and the spurns
    That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? who would fardels[136-1] bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death,
    The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
    No traveller returns, puzzles the will
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry,
    And lose the name of action.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._
                   Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins remember'd.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    I am myself indifferent honest.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._
     Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
     calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._
     I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God has given
     you one face, and you make yourselves another.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's eye, tongue, sword.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    The observed of all observers!
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._
                                   O, woe is me,
    To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 1._
     Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
     gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, the
     whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance
     that may give it smoothness. Oh, it offends me to the soul to
     hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters,
     to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the
     most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and
     noise. I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing
     Termagant; it out-herods Herod.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
     Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this
     special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    To hold, as 't were, the mirror up to nature.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
     The very age and body of the time his form and pressure.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
     Though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
     grieve.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Not to speak it profanely.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
     I have thought some of Nature's journeymen had made men and not
     made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    _First Play._ We have reformed that indifferently with
    us, sir.
    _Ham._ O, reform it altogether.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation coped withal.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
      They are not a pipe for fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee.--Something too much of this.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Here 's metal more attractive.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
     Nay, then, let the devil wear black, for I 'll have a suit of
     sables.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
     There 's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a
     year.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    For, O, for, O, the hobby-horse is forgot.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    This is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    _Ham._ Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
    _Oph._ 'T is brief, my lord.
    _Ham._ As woman's love.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Our wills and fates do so contrary run
    That our devices still are overthrown.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    The lady doth protest[138-1] too much, methinks.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Let the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    The story is extant, and writ in choice Italian.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
      The hart ungalled play;
    For some must watch, while some must sleep:
      So runs the world away.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    'T is as easy as lying.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    It will discourse most eloquent music.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Pluck out the heart of my mystery.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe?
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
     _Ham._ Do you see yonder cloud that 's almost in shape of a
     camel?
     _Pol._ By the mass, and 't is like a camel, indeed.
     _Ham._ Methinks it is like a weasel.
     _Pol._ It is backed like a weasel.
     _Ham._ Or like a whale?
     _Pol._ Very like a whale.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    They fool me to the top of my bent.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    By and by is easily said.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    'T is now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon 't,
    A brother's murder.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 3._
           Like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 3._
                           'T is not so above;
    There is no shuffling, there the action lies
    In his true nature.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay!
    Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 3._
                       About some act
    That has no relish of salvation in 't.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    Dead, for a ducat, dead!
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
    If it be made of penetrable stuff.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                           Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    False as dicers' oaths.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    A rhapsody of words.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                                    What act
    That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See, what a grace was seated on this brow:
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill,
    A combination and a form indeed,
    Where every god did seem to set his seal,
    To give the world assurance of a man.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                             At your age
    The hey-day in the blood is tame, it 's humble.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellions hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
    And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
    And put it in his pocket!
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    A king of shreds and patches.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                      How is 't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy?
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    This is the very coinage of your brain:
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                       Bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will re-word; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what 's past; avoid what is to come.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
    Of habits devil, is angel yet in this.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                        Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    I must be cruel, only to be kind:
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
_Hamlet. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    For 't is the sport to have the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar.

    By desperate appliance are relieved,
    Or not at all.
_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 3._
     A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of
     the fish that hath fed of that worm.
_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unused.
_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 4._
                      Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour 's at the stake.
_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 4._
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 5._
    We know what we are, but know not what we may be.
_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 5._
    To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
    All in the morning betime.

    Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes.
_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 5._
    Come, my coach! Good night, sweet ladies; good night.

    But in battalions.

    There 's such divinity doth hedge a king,
    That treason can but peep to what it would.

    After the thing it loves.

     There 's rosemary, that 's for remembrance; . . . and there is
     pansies, that 's for thoughts.
_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 5._
     You must wear your rue with a difference. There 's a daisy; I
     would give you some violets, but they withered.
_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 5._
    His beard was as white as snow,
    All flaxen was his poll.
_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 5._
    A very riband in the cap of youth.
_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 7._
                        That we would do,
    We should do when we would.
_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 7._
    One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow.
_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 7._
                 Nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will.
_Hamlet. Act iv. Sc. 7._
     _1 Clo._ Argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens
     not his own life.
     _2 Clo._ But is this law?
     _1 Clo._ Ay, marry, is 't; crowner's quest law.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._
     There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._

_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._
     Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._
     The hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._
     A politician, . . . one that would circumvent God.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._
     Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his
     quiddities now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his
     tricks?
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._
     One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she 's dead.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._
     How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the card, or
     equivocation will undo us.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._
     The age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so
     near the heel of the courtier, he galls his kibe.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._
     Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite
     jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath borne me on his back a
     thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! my
     gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
     not how oft. Where be your gibes now; your gambols, your songs?
     your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a
     roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite chap-fallen?
     Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an
     inch thick, to this favour she must come.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._
     To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination
     trace the noble dust of Alexander, till we find it stopping a
     bung-hole?
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._
    'T were to consider too curiously, to consider so.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._
    Imperious Cæsar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._
                   Lay her i' the earth:
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring!
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._
    A ministering angel shall my sister be.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._
    Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._
        Though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I something in me dangerous.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 1._
                       Forty thousand brothers
    Could not, with all their quantity of love,
    Make up my sum.

    Rough-hew them how we will.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._
    It did me yeoman's service.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._
           The bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a towering passion.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._
    What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._
     The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we could carry
     cannon by our sides.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._
    'T is the breathing time of day with me.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._
     There 's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be
     now, 't is not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if
     it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all. Since no
     man has aught of what he leaves, what is 't to leave betimes?
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._
       I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
    And hurt my brother.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._
    Now the king drinks to Hamlet.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._
    A hit, a very palpable hit.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._
                        This fell sergeant, death,
    Is strict in his arrest.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._
    Report me and my cause aright.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._
    Absent thee from felicity awhile.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._
    The rest is silence.
_Hamlet. Act v. Sc. 2._
    Although the last, not least.
_King Lear. Act i. Sc. 1._
    Nothing will come of nothing.
_King Lear. Act i. Sc. 1._
                     Mend your speech a little,

_King Lear. Act i. Sc. 1._
          I want that glib and oily art,
    To speak and purpose not.
_King Lear. Act i. Sc. 1._
    A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
    As I am glad I have not.
_King Lear. Act i. Sc. 1._
    Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides.

     best of me is diligence.

    Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend!
_King Lear. Act i. Sc. 4._

    Striving to better, oft we mar what 's well.
_King Lear. Act i. Sc. 4._
    Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,
    Thy element 's below.

      Let not women's weapons, water-drops,
    Stain my man's cheeks!
_King Lear. Act ii. Sc. 4._
    Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.
_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man.
_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 2._
     There was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass.
_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 2._
                   Tremble, thou wretch,
    That hast within thee undivulged crimes,
    Unwhipp'd of justice.
_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 2._
                                I am a man
    More sinn'd against than sinning.
_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Oh, that way madness lies; let me shun that.
_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,
    That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
    How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
    Your looped and windowed raggedness, defend you
    From seasons such as these?
_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                      Take physic, pomp;
    Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel.
_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    Out-paramoured the Turk.
_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    'T is a naughty night to swim in.
_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 4._

    But mice and rats, and such small deer,
    Have been Tom's food for seven long year.

    The prince of darkness is a gentleman.
_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    Poor Tom 's a-cold.
_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    I 'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    Child Rowland to the dark tower came,
    His word was still,--Fie, foh, and fum,
    I smell the blood of a British man.
_King Lear. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                     The little dogs and all,
    Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me.

    Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,

                    Patience and sorrow strove
    Who should express her goodliest.
_King Lear. Act iv. Sc. 3._
                          Half way down
    Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!
    Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:
    The fishermen that walk upon the beach
    Appear like mice.
_King Lear. Act iv. Sc. 6._
    Nature 's above art in that respect.
_King Lear. Act iv. Sc. 6._
    Ay, every inch a king.
_King Lear. Act iv. Sc. 6._
     Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my
     imagination.
_King Lear. Act iv. Sc. 6._
     A man may see how this world goes with no eyes. Look with thine
     ears: see how yond justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in
     thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which is the justice,
     which is the thief?
_King Lear. Act iv. Sc. 6._

    Robes and furr'd gowns hide all.
_King Lear. Act iv. Sc. 6._
                     Mine enemy's dog,
    Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
    Against my fire.

    Pray you now, forget and forgive.
_King Lear. Act iv. Sc. 7._
    Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
    The gods themselves throw incense.
_King Lear. Act v. Sc. 3._
    The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
    Make instruments to plague us.
_King Lear. Act v. Sc. 3._
                     Her voice was ever soft,
    Gentle, and low,--an excellent thing in woman.
_King Lear. Act v. Sc. 3._
    Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him much
    That would upon the rack of this tough world
    Stretch him out longer.
_King Lear. Act v. Sc. 3._
    That never set a squadron in the field,
    Nor the division of a battle knows.
_Othello. Act i. Sc. 1._
    The bookish theoric.
_Othello. Act i. Sc. 1._
                'T is the curse of service,
    Preferment goes by letter and affection,
    And not by old gradation, where each second
    Stood heir to the first.
_Othello. Act i. Sc. 1._
    We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
    Cannot be truly follow'd.
_Othello. Act i. Sc. 1._
    Whip me such honest knaves.

     You are one of those that will not serve God, if the devil bid
     you.
_Othello. Act i. Sc. 1._
    The wealthy curled darlings of our nation.
_Othello. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
    My very noble and approv'd good masters,
    That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
    It is most true; true, I have married her:
    The very head and front of my offending
    Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,
    And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:
    For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
    Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
    Their dearest action in the tented field,
    And little of this great world can I speak,
    More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,
    And therefore little shall I grace my cause
    In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
    I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
    Of my whole course of love.
_Othello. Act i. Sc. 3._
    Her father loved me; oft invited me;
    Still question'd me the story of my life,
    From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
    That I have passed.
    I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
    To the very moment that he bade me tell it:
    Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
    Of moving accidents by flood and field,
    Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
    Of being taken by the insolent foe
    And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
    And portance in my travels' history;
    Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
    Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven,
    It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;
    And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
    The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads
    Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
    Would Desdemona seriously incline.
_Othello. Act i. Sc. 3._
    And often did beguile her of her tears,
    When I did speak of some distressful stroke
    That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
    She gave me for my pains a world of sighs;
    She swore, in faith, 't was strange, 't was passing strange.
    'T was pitiful, 't was wondrous pitiful;
    She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
    That Heaven had made her such a man; she thank'd me,
    And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
    I should but teach him how to tell my story,
    And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
    She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
    And I loved her that she did pity them.
    This only is the witchcraft I have used.
_Othello. Act i. Sc. 3._
    I do perceive here a divided duty.
_Othello. Act i. Sc. 3._
    The robb'd that smiles, steals something from the thief.
_Othello. Act i. Sc. 3._
    The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
    Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
    My thrice-driven bed of down.

_Othello. Act i. Sc. 3._

     The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to
     him shortly as bitter as coloquintida.
_Othello. Act i. Sc. 3._
    Framed to make women false.
_Othello. Act i. Sc. 3._
    One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens.
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    For I am nothing, if not critical.
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    I am not merry; but I do beguile
    The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    She that was ever fair and never proud,
    Had tongue at will, and yet was never loud.
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    She was a wight, if ever such wight were,
      _Des._ To do what?
      _Iago._ To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
      _Des._ O most lame and impotent conclusion!
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 1._
     You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar.
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 1._

    May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    Egregiously an ass.
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking.
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    Potations pottle-deep.
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    King Stephen was a worthy peer,
      His breeches cost him but a crown;
    He held them sixpence all too dear,
      With that he called the tailor lown.
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle
    From her propriety.
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._
                   Your name is great
    In mouths of wisest censure.
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter.
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._
                Cassio, I love thee;
    But never more be officer of mine.
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    _Iago._ What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
    _Cas._ Ay, past all surgery.
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._
     Reputation, reputation, reputation! Oh, I have lost my
     reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what
     remains is bestial.
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._
     O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known
     by, let us call thee devil!
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._
     O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
     their brains!
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._
     _Cas._ Every inordinate cup is unbless'd, and the ingredient is a
     devil.
     _Iago._ Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it
     be well used.
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    How poor are they that have not patience!
_Othello. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
    But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,
    Chaos is come again.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
            Speak to me as to thy thinkings,
    As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
    The worst of words.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
    Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
    Who steals my purse steals trash; 't is something, nothing;
    'T was mine, 't is his, and has been slave to thousands;
    But he that filches from me my good name
    Robs me of that which not enriches him
    And makes me poor indeed.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
                 O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
    It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
    The meat it feeds on.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
    Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly[153-2] loves!
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    Poor and content is rich and rich enough.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
                    To be once in doubt
    Is once to be resolv'd.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
                If I do prove her haggard,
    Though that her jesses were my dear heart-strings,
    I 'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,
    To prey at fortune.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
                         I am declined
    Into the vale of years.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
                 O curse of marriage,
    That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
    And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
    And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,
    Than keep a corner in the thing I love
    For others' uses.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
                  Trifles light as air
    Are to the jealous confirmations strong
    As proofs of holy writ.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
                  Not poppy, nor mandragora,
    Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
    Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
    Which thou owedst yesterday.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    I swear 't is better to be much abused
    Than but to know 't a little.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stolen,
    Let him not know 't, and he 's not robb'd at all.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
                      O, now, for ever
    Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!
    Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars
    That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!
    Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,
    The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
    The royal banner, and all quality,
    Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!
    And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
    The immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit,
    Farewell! Othello's occupation 's gone!
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
                        No hinge nor loop
    To hang a doubt on.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    On horror's head horrors accumulate.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
               Take note, take note, O world,
    To be direct and honest is not safe.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
                  Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
    For 't is of aspics' tongues!
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
                     Like to the Pontic sea,
    Whose icy current and compulsive course
    Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
    To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
    Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
    Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
    Till that a capable and wide revenge
    Swallow them up.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    Our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.
_Othello. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    To beguile many, and be beguil'd by one.
_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    They laugh that win.
_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 1._
     But yet the pity of it, Iago! O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!
_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    I understand a fury in your words,
    But not the words.
_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 2._
    Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips.
_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 2._
                     But, alas, to make me
    A fixed figure for the time of scorn
    To point his slow unmoving finger[155-2] at!
_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 2._
    Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin.
_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 2._
                            O thou weed,
    Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
    That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born.
_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 2._
    O Heaven, that such companions thou 'ldst unfold,
    And put in every honest hand a whip
    To lash the rascals naked through the world!
_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 2._
    'T is neither here nor there.
_Othello. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    It makes us or it mars us.
_Othello. Act v. Sc. 1._
    Every way makes my gain.
_Othello. Act v. Sc. 1._
    He hath a daily beauty in his life.
_Othello. Act v. Sc. 1._
                         This is the night
    That either makes me or fordoes me quite.
_Othello. Act v. Sc. 1._
    And smooth as monumental alabaster.
_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._
    Put out the light, and then put out the light:
    If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
    I can again thy former light restore
    Should I repent me; but once put out thy light,
    Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,
    I know not where is that Promethean heat
    That can thy light relume.
_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._
    So sweet was ne'er so fatal.
_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._
    Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge
    Had stomach for them all.
_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._
    One entire and perfect chrysolite.
_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._
    Curse his better angel from his side,
    And fall to reprobation.
_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._
    Every puny whipster.
_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._
    Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
    And he retires.
_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._
    I have done the state some service, and they know 't.
    No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
    When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
    Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
    Nor set down aught in malice. Then, must you speak
    Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
    Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought
    Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
    Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
    Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,
    Albeit unused to the melting mood,
    Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
    Their medicinal gum.
_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._
    I took by the throat the circumcised dog,
    And smote him, thus.
_Othello. Act v. Sc. 2._
    There 's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act i. Sc. 1._
                             On the sudden
    A Roman thought hath struck him.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act i. Sc. 2._
    This grief is crowned with consolation.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act i. Sc. 2._
    Give me to drink mandragora.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act i. Sc. 5._
    Where 's my serpent of old Nile?
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act i. Sc. 5._
    A morsel for a monarch.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act i. Sc. 5._
                         My salad days,
    When I was green in judgment.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act i. Sc. 5._
                          Epicurean cooks
    Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    Small to greater matters must give way.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
    Burn'd on the water; the poop was beaten gold;
    Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
    The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
    Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
    The water which they beat to follow faster,
    As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
    It beggar'd all description.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
    Her infinite variety.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act ii. Sc. 2._
    I have not kept my square; but that to come
    Shall all be done by the rule.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act ii. Sc. 3._
                         'T was merry when
    You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
    Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he
    With fervency drew up.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act ii. Sc. 5._
    Come, thou monarch of the vine,
    Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act ii. Sc. 7._
    Who does i' the wars more than his captain can
    Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition,
    The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,
    Than gain which darkens him.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iii. Sc. 1._
                   He wears the rose
    Of youth upon him.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iii. Sc. 13._
                         Men's judgments are
    A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward
    Do draw the inward quality after them,
    To suffer all alike.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iii. Sc. 13._
    To business that we love we rise betime,
    And go to 't with delight.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iv. Sc. 4._
    This morning, like the spirit of a youth
    That means to be of note, begins betimes.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iv. Sc. 4._
    The shirt of Nessus is upon me.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iv. Sc. 12._
    Sometime we see a cloud that 's dragonish;
    A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
    A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
    A forked mountain, or blue promontory
    With trees upon 't.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iv. Sc. 14._
    That which is now a horse, even with a thought
    The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,
    As water is in water.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iv. Sc. 14._
                         Since Cleopatra died,
    I have liv'd in such dishonour that the gods
    Detest my baseness.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iv. Sc. 14._
    I am dying, Egypt, dying.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iv. Sc. 15._
    O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
    The soldier's pole is fallen.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iv. Sc. 15._
    Let 's do it after the high Roman fashion.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act iv. Sc. 15._
                         For his bounty,
    There was no winter in 't; an autumn 't was
    That grew the more by reaping.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act v. Sc. 2._
              If there be, or ever were, one such,
    It 's past the size of dreaming.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act v. Sc. 2._
                       Mechanic slaves
    With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act v. Sc. 2._
                              I have
    Immortal longings in me.
_Antony and Cleopatra. Act v. Sc. 2._
    Lest the bargain should catch cold and starve.
_Cymbeline. Act i. Sc. 4._
    Hath his bellyful of fighting.
_Cymbeline. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily.
_Cymbeline. Act ii. Sc. 2._
     The most patient man in loss, the most coldest that ever turned
     up ace.
_Cymbeline. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,
      And Phoebus 'gins arise,
    His steeds to water at those springs
      On chaliced flowers that lies;
    And winking Mary-buds begin
      To ope their golden eyes:
    With everything that pretty is,
      My lady sweet, arise.
_Cymbeline. Act ii. Sc. 3._
    As chaste as unsunn'd snow.
_Cymbeline. Act ii. Sc. 5._
    Some griefs are medicinable.
_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk.
_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 3._
                           So slippery that
    The fear 's as bad as falling.
_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 3._
    The game is up.
_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 3._
                     No, 't is slander,
    Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue
    Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
    Rides on the posting winds, and doth belie
    All corners of the world.
_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                   Some jay of Italy,
    Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:
    Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion.
_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    It is no act of common passage, but
    A strain of rareness.
_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 4._
    I have not slept one wink.
_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                    Thou art all the comfort
    The gods will diet me with.
_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 4._
                              Weariness
    Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth
    Finds the down pillow hard.
_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 6._
                     An angel! or, if not,
    An earthly paragon!
_Cymbeline. Act iii. Sc. 6._
    Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
    Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
_Cymbeline. Act iv. Sc. 2._
                              And put
    My clouted brogues from off my feet.
_Cymbeline. Act iv. Sc. 2._
    Golden lads and girls all must,
    As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.
_Cymbeline. Act iv. Sc. 2._
                   O, never say hereafter
    But I am truest speaker. You call'd me brother
    When I was but your sister.
_Cymbeline. Act v. Sc. 5._
                       Like an arrow shot
    From a well-experienc'd archer hits the mark
    His eye doth level at.
_Pericles. Act i. Sc. 1._
     _3 Fish._ Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea.
     _1 Fish._ Why, as men do a-land: the great ones eat up the little
     ones.
_Pericles. Act ii. Sc. 1._
    Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear.
_Venus and Adonis. Line 145._
    For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,
    And, beauty dead, black chaos comes again.
_Venus and Adonis. Line 1019._
    The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light.
_Venus and Adonis. Line 1027._
    For greatest scandal waits on greatest state.
_Lucrece. Line 1006._
    Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee
    Calls back the lovely April of her prime.
_Sonnet iii._
    And stretched metre of an antique song.
_Sonnet xvii._
    But thy eternal summer shall not fade.
_Sonnet xviii._
    The painful warrior famoused for fight,
    After a thousand victories, once foil'd,
    Is from the books of honour razed quite,
    And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd.
_Sonnet xxv._
    When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
    I summon up remembrance of things past,
    I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
    And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste.
_Sonnet xxx._
    Full many a glorious morning have I seen.
_Sonnet xxxiii._
    My grief lies onward and my joy behind.
_Sonnet l._
    Like stones of worth, they thinly placed are,
    Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
_Sonnet lii._
    The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
    For that sweet odour which doth in it live.
_Sonnet liv._
    Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
    Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme.
_Sonnet lv._
    Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
    But sad mortality o'ersways their power,
    How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
    Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
_Sonnet lxv._
    And art made tongue-tied by authority.
_Sonnet lxvi._
    And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
    And captive good attending captain ill.
_Sonnet lxvi._
    The ornament of beauty is suspect,
    A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
_Sonnet lxx._
    That time of year thou may'st in me behold,
    When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
    Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
    Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
_Sonnet lxxiii._
    Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
    Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,
    And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
    When all the breathers of this world are dead;
    You still shall live--such virtue hath my pen
    Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.
_Sonnet lxxxi._
    Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing.
_Sonnet lxxxvii._
          Do not drop in for an after-loss.
    Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scap'd this sorrow,
    Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;
    Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
    To linger out a purpos'd overthrow.
_Sonnet xc._
    When proud-pied April, dress'd in all his trim,
    Hath put a spirit of youth in everything.
_Sonnet xcviii._
    Still constant is a wondrous excellence.
_Sonnet cv._
    And beauty, making beautiful old rhyme.
_Sonnet cvi._
                     My nature is subdu'd
    To what it works in, like the dyer's hand.
_Sonnet cxi._
    Let me not to the marriage of true minds
    Admit impediments: love is not love
    Which alters when it alteration finds.
_Sonnet cxvi._
    'T is better to be vile than vile esteem'd,
    When not to be receives reproach of being;
    And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd,
    Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing.
_Sonnet cxxi._
    No, I am that I am, and they that level
    At my abuses reckon up their own.
_Sonnet cxxi._
    That full star that ushers in the even.
_Sonnet cxxxii._
    So on the tip of his subduing tongue
    All kinds of arguments and questions deep,
    All replication prompt, and reason strong,
    For his advantage still did wake and sleep.
    To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,
    He had the dialect and different skill,
    Catching all passion in his craft of will.
_A Lover's Complaint. Line 120._
    O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies
    In the small orb of one particular tear.
_A Lover's Complaint. Line 288._
    Bad in the best, though excellent in neither.
_The Passionate Pilgrim. iii._
    Crabbed age and youth
    Cannot live together.
_The Passionate Pilgrim. viii._
    Have you not heard it said full oft,
    A woman's nay doth stand for naught?
_The Passionate Pilgrim. xiv._
    Cursed be he that moves my bones.
_Shakespeare's Epitaph._
(An injury graves itself in metal, but a benefit writes itself in water.)
    JEAN BERTAUT. _Circa 1611._
FRANCIS BACON. 1561-1626.
(_Works: Spedding and Ellis_).
     I hold every man a debtor to his profession; from the which as
     men of course do seek to receive countenance and profit, so ought
     they of duty to endeavour themselves by way of amends to be a
     help and ornament thereunto.
_Maxims of the Law. Preface._
     Come home to men's business and bosoms.
_Dedication to the Essays, Edition 1625._
     No pleasure is comparable to the standing upon the vantage-ground
     of truth.
_Of Truth._
     Men fear death as children fear to go in the dark; and as that
     natural fear in children is increased with tales, so is the
     other.
_Of Death._
     Revenge is a kind of wild justice, which the more man's nature
     runs to, the more ought law to weed it out.
_Of Revenge._
     It was a high speech of Seneca (after the manner of the Stoics),
     that "The good things which belong to prosperity are to be
     wished, but the good things that belong to adversity are to be
     admired."
_Of Adversity._
     It is yet a higher speech of his than the other, "It is true
     greatness to have in one the frailty of a man and the security of
     a god."
_Of Adversity._
     Prosperity is the blessing of the Old Testament; adversity is the
     blessing of the New.
_Of Adversity._
     Prosperity is not without many fears and distastes; and adversity
     is not without comforts and hopes.
_Of Adversity._
     Virtue is like precious odours,--most fragrant when they are
     incensed or crushed.
_Of Adversity._
     He that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune;
     for they are impediments to great enterprises, either of virtue
     or mischief.
_Of Marriage and Single Life._
     Wives are young men's mistresses, companions for middle age, and
     old men's nurses.
_Of Marriage and Single Life._
     Men in great place are thrice servants,--servants of the
     sovereign or state, servants of fame, and servants of business.
_Of Great Place._
     Mahomet made the people believe that he would call a hill to him,
     and from the top of it offer up his prayers for the observers of
     his law. The people assembled. Mahomet called the hill to come to
     him, again and again; and when the hill stood still he was never
     a whit abashed, but said, "If the hill will not come to Mahomet,
     Mahomet will go to the hill."
_Of Boldness._
     The desire of power in excess caused the angels to fall; the
     desire of knowledge in excess caused man to fall.
_Of Goodness._
     The remedy is worse than the disease.
_Of Seditions._
     I had rather believe all the fables in the legends and the Talmud
     and the Alcoran, than that this universal frame is without a
     mind.
_Of Atheism._
     A little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism, but depth in
     philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion.
_Of Atheism._
     Travel, in the younger sort, is a part of education; in the
     elder, a part of experience. He that travelleth into a country
     before he hath some entrance into the language, goeth to school,
     and not to travel.
_Of Travel._
     Princes are like to heavenly bodies, which cause good or evil
     times, and which have much veneration but no rest.
_Of Empire._
     In things that a man would not be seen in himself, it is a point
     of cunning to borrow the name of the world; as to say, "The world
     says," or "There is a speech abroad."
_Of Cunning._
     There is a cunning which we in England call "the turning of the
     cat in the pan;" which is, when that which a man says to another,
     he lays it as if another had said it to him.
_Of Cunning._
     It is a good point of cunning for a man to shape the answer he
     would have in his own words and propositions, for it makes the
     other party stick the less.
_Of Cunning._
     It hath been an opinion that the French are wiser than they seem,
     and the Spaniards seem wiser than they are; but howsoever it be
     between nations, certainly it is so between man and man.
_Of Seeming Wise._
     There is a wisdom in this beyond the rules of physic. A man's own
     observation, what he finds good of and what he finds hurt of, is
     the best physic to preserve health.
_Of Regimen of Health._
     Discretion of speech is more than eloquence; and to speak
     agreeably to him with whom we deal is more than to speak in good
     words or in good order.
_Of Discourse._
     Men's thoughts are much according to their inclination,
     their discourse and speeches according to their learning and
     infused opinions.
_Of Custom and Education._
     Chiefly the mould of a man's fortune is in his own hands.
_Of Fortune._
     If a man look sharply and attentively, he shall see Fortune; for
     though she is blind, she is not invisible.
_Of Fortune._
     Young men are fitter to invent than to judge, fitter for
     execution than for counsel, and fitter for new projects than for
     settled business.
_Of Youth and Age._
     Virtue is like a rich stone,--best plain set.
_Of Beauty._
     God Almighty first planted a garden.
_Of Gardens._
     And because the breath of flowers is far sweeter in the air
     (where it comes and goes, like the warbling of music) than in the
     hand, therefore nothing is more fit for that delight than to know
     what be the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air.
_Of Gardens._
     Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few
     to be chewed and digested.
_Of Studies._
     Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an
     exact man.
_Of Studies._
     Histories make men wise; poets, witty; the mathematics, subtile;
     natural philosophy, deep; moral, grave; logic and rhetoric, able
     to contend.
_Of Studies._
     The greatest vicissitude of things amongst men is the vicissitude
     of sects and religions.
_Of Vicissitude of Things._
     Books must follow sciences, and not sciences books.
_Proposition touching Amendment of Laws._
     Knowledge is power.--Nam et ipsa scientia potestas est.
_Meditationes Sacræ. De Hæresibus._
     Whence we see spiders, flies, or ants entombed and preserved
     forever in amber, a more than royal tomb.
_Historia Vitæ et Mortis; Sylva Sylvarum, Cent. i. Exper. 100._
     When you wander, as you often delight to do, you wander indeed,
     and give never such satisfaction as the curious time requires.
     This is not caused by any natural defect, but first for want of
     election, when you, having a large and fruitful mind, should not
     so much labour what to speak as to find what to leave unspoken.
     Rich soils are often to be weeded.
_Letter of Expostulation to Coke._
     "Antiquitas sæculi juventus mundi." These times are the ancient
     times, when the world is ancient, and not those which we account
     ancient _ordine retrogrado_, by a computation backward from
     ourselves.

_Advancement of Learning. Book ii._

      Less than a span.
_The World._
    Who then to frail mortality shall trust
    But limns on water, or but writes in dust.
_The World._
    What then remains but that we still should cry
    For being born, and, being born, to die?
_The World._
     For my name and memory, I leave it to men's charitable speeches,
     to foreign nations, and to the next ages.
_From his Will._
     My Lord St. Albans said that Nature did never put her precious
     jewels into a garret four stories high, and therefore that
     exceeding tall men had ever very empty heads.

     Alonso of Aragon was wont to say in commendation of age, that age

     read.
_Apothegms. No. 97._
     Pyrrhus, when his friends congratulated to him his victory over
     the Romans under Fabricius, but with great slaughter of his own
     side, said to them, "Yes; but if we have such another victory, we
     are undone."
_Apothegms. No. 193._
     Cosmus, Duke of Florence, was wont to say of perfidious friends,

_Address to the Nightingale._
SIR JOHN DAVIES. 1570-1626.

     despair and are in a consumption for fear they shall never get
     out.
_The White Devil. Act i. Sc. 2._

JOHN FLETCHER. 1576-1625.
    Man is his own star; and the soul that can
    Render an honest and a perfect man
    Commands all light, all influence, all fate.
    Nothing to him falls early, or too late.
    Our acts our angels are, or good or ill,
    Our fatal shadows that walk by us still.
_Upon an "Honest Man's Fortune."_

    Falls with the leaf still in October.
_The Bloody Brother. Act ii. Sc. 2._

      And three merry boys are we,
    As ever did sing in a hempen string

_The Bloody Brother. Act iii. Sc. 2._
    Hide, oh, hide those hills of snow
      Which thy frozen bosom bears,

    Like the sparks of fire, befriend thee.

    To write a verse or two is all the praise

_Praise._
    Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,
    The bridal of the earth and sky.
_Virtue._

_The Complete Angler. Author's Preface._
     Angling may be said to be so like the mathematics that it can
     never be fully learnt.
_The Complete Angler. Author's Preface._
     As no man is born an artist, so no man is born an angler.
_The Complete Angler. Author's Preface._
     I shall stay him no longer than to wish him a rainy evening to
     read this following discourse; and that if he be an honest
     angler, the east wind may never blow when he goes a fishing.
_The Complete Angler. Author's Preface._
     As the Italians say, Good company in a journey makes the way to
     seem the shorter.
_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 1._
     I am, sir, a Brother of the Angle.
_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 1._
     It [angling] deserves commendations; . . . it is an art worthy
     the knowledge and practice of a wise man.
_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 1._
     Angling is somewhat like poetry,--men are to be born so.
_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 1._
     Doubt not but angling will prove to be so pleasant that it will
     prove to be, like virtue, a reward to itself.
_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 1._
     Sir Henry Wotton was a most dear lover and a frequent practiser
     of the Art of Angling; of which he would say, "'T was an
     employment for his idle time, which was then not idly spent, a
     rest to his mind, a cheerer of his spirits, a diverter of
     sadness, a calmer of unquiet thoughts, a moderator of passions, a
     procurer of contentedness;" and "that it begat habits of peace
     and patience in those that professed and practised it."
_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 1._
     You will find angling to be like the virtue of humility, which
     has a calmness of spirit and a world of other blessings attending
     upon it.
_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 1._
     I remember that a wise friend of mine did usually say, "That

     Old-fashioned poetry, but choicely good.
_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. iv._
     No man can lose what he never had.
_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. v._
     We may say of angling as Dr. Boteler[208-1] said of strawberries:
     "Doubtless God could have made a better berry, but doubtless God
     never did;" and so, if I might be judge, God never did make a
     more calm, quiet, innocent recreation than angling.
_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. v._
     Thus use your frog: put your hook--I mean the arming
     wire--through his mouth and out at his gills, and then with a
     fine needle and silk sew the upper part of his leg with only one
     stitch to the arming wire of your hook, or tie the frog's leg
     above the upper joint to the armed wire; and in so doing use him
     as though you loved him.
_The Complete Angler. Part i. Chap. 8._
     This dish of meat is too good for any but anglers, or very honest
     men.

     Providence, and be quiet and go a-angling.

JAMES SHIRLEY. 1596-1666.
    The glories of our blood and state

    We grant, although he had much wit,
    He was very shy of using it.
_Hudibras. Part i. Canto i. Line 45._
    Beside, 't is known he could speak Greek

    He could distinguish and divide
    A hair 'twixt south and southwest side.

    The ghosts of defunct bodies, fly.
_Hudibras. Part i. Canto i. Line 145._

    Compound for sins they are inclined to,
    By damning those they have no mind to.
_Hudibras. Part i. Canto i. Line 215._
    The trenchant blade, Toledo trusty,
    For want of fighting was grown rusty,
    And ate into itself, for lack
    Of somebody to hew and hack.
_Hudibras. Part i. Canto i. Line 359._
    For rhyme the rudder is of verses,
    With which, like ships, they steer their courses.
_Hudibras. Part i. Canto i. Line 463._

    With many a stiff thwack, many a bang,
    Hard crab-tree and old iron rang.
_Hudibras. Part i. Canto ii. Line 831._
    Like feather bed betwixt a wall

    If he that in the field is slain
    Be in the bed of honour lain,
    He that is beaten may be said

               Friend Ralph, thou hast
    Outrun the constable[212-3] at last.
_Hudibras. Part i. Canto iii. Line 1367._
    Some force whole regions, in despite
    O' geography, to change their site;
    Make former times shake hands with latter,
    And that which was before come after.
    But those that write in rhyme still make
    The one verse for the other's sake;
    For one for sense, and one for rhyme,
    I think 's sufficient at one time.
_Hudibras. Part ii. Canto i. Line 23._
    Some have been beaten till they know
    What wood a cudgel 's of by th' blow;
    Some kick'd until they can feel whether
    A shoe be Spanish or neat's leather.

_Hudibras. Part ii. Canto i. Line 273._
    Quoth she, I 've heard old cunning stagers
    Say fools for arguments use wagers.
_Hudibras. Part ii. Canto i. Line 297._
    Love in your hearts as idly burns
    As fire in antique Roman urns.
_Hudibras. Part ii. Canto i. Line 309._
    For what is worth in anything
    But so much money as 't will bring?
_Hudibras. Part ii. Canto i. Line 465._
    Love is a boy by poets styl'd;
    Then spare the rod and spoil the child.
_Hudibras. Part ii. Canto i. Line 843._
    The sun had long since in the lap
    Of Thetis taken out his nap,
    And, like a lobster boil'd, the morn
    From black to red began to turn.
_Hudibras. Part ii. Canto ii. Line 29._
    Have always been at daggers-drawing,
    And one another clapper-clawing.
_Hudibras. Part ii. Canto ii. Line 79._
    For truth is precious and divine,
    Too rich a pearl for carnal swine.
_Hudibras. Part ii. Canto ii. Line 257._
    Why should not conscience have vacation
    As well as other courts o' th' nation?
_Hudibras. Part ii. Canto ii. Line 317._
    He that imposes an oath makes it,
    Not he that for convenience takes it;
    Then how can any man be said
    To break an oath he never made?
_Hudibras. Part ii. Canto ii. Line 377._
                      As the ancients
    Say wisely, have a care o' th' main chance,
    And look before you ere you leap;

    To swallow gudgeons ere they 're catch'd,
    And count their chickens ere they 're hatch'd.
_Hudibras. Part ii. Canto iii. Line 923._
    There 's but the twinkling of a star
    Between a man of peace and war.
_Hudibras. Part ii. Canto iii. Line 957._
    But Hudibras gave him a twitch
    As quick as lightning in the breech,
    Just in the place where honour 's lodg'd,
    As wise philosophers have judg'd;
    Because a kick in that part more
    Hurts honour than deep wounds before.
_Hudibras. Part ii. Canto iii. Line 1065._
    As men of inward light are wont
    To turn their optics in upon 't.
_Hudibras. Part iii. Canto i. Line 481._
    Still amorous and fond and billing,
    Like Philip and Mary on a shilling.
_Hudibras. Part iii. Canto i. Line 687._
    What makes all doctrines plain and clear?
    About two hundred pounds a year.
    And that which was prov'd true before
    Prove false again? Two hundred more.
_Hudibras. Part iii. Canto i. Line 1277._
    'Cause grace and virtue are within
    Prohibited degrees of kin;
    And therefore no true saint allows
    They shall be suffer'd to espouse.
_Hudibras. Part iii. Canto i. Line 1293._
    Nick Machiavel had ne'er a trick,
    Though he gave his name to our Old Nick.
_Hudibras. Part iii. Canto i. Line 1313._
    With crosses, relics, crucifixes,
    Beads, pictures, rosaries, and pixes,
    The tools of working our salvation
    By mere mechanic operation.
_Hudibras. Part iii. Canto i. Line 1495._
    True as the dial to the sun,
    Although it be not shin'd upon.
_Hudibras. Part iii. Canto ii. Line 175._
    But still his tongue ran on, the less
    Of weight it bore, with greater ease.
_Hudibras. Part iii. Canto ii. Line 443._
    For those that fly may fight again,
    Which he can never do that 's slain.
_Hudibras. Part iii. Canto iii. Line 243._
    He that complies against his will
    Is of his own opinion still.
_Hudibras. Part iii. Canto iii. Line 547._
    With books and money plac'd for show
    Like nest-eggs to make clients lay,
    And for his false opinion pay.
_Hudibras. Part iii. Canto iii. Line 624._
    And poets by their sufferings grow,
    As if there were no more to do,
    To make a poet excellent,
    But only want and discontent.

_Divine Love. Canto iii._
    The soul's dark cottage, batter'd and decay'd,
    Lets in new light through chinks that Time has made.

    That stand upon the threshold of the new.

    Mammon, the least erected spirit that fell
    From heaven; for ev'n in heaven his looks and thoughts
    Were always downward bent, admiring more
    The riches of heaven's pavement, trodden gold,
    Than aught divine or holy else enjoy'd

                        Th' ethereal mould
    Incapable of stain would soon expel

    Is flat despair.
_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 139._
                     For who would lose,
    Though full of pain, this intellectual being,

                             With grave
    Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd
    A pillar of state; deep on his front engraven
    Deliberation sat, and public care;
    And princely counsel in his face yet shone,
    Majestic though in ruin: sage he stood,
    With Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear
    The weight of mightiest monarchies; his look
    Drew audience and attention still as night
    Or summer's noontide air.
_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 300._

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 490._
    Oh, shame to men! devil with devil damn'd
    Firm concord holds, men only disagree
    Of creatures rational.
_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 496._
                 In discourse more sweet;
    For eloquence the soul, song charms the sense.
    Others apart sat on a hill retir'd,
    In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high
    Of providence, foreknowledge, will, and fate,
    Fix'd fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute;

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 565._
                   Arm th' obdur'd breast

_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 568._
    A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog
    Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old,
    Where armies whole have sunk: the parching air
    Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of fire.
    Thither by harpy-footed Furies hal'd,
    At certain revolutions all the damn'd
    Are brought, and feel by turns the bitter change
    Of fierce extremes,--extremes by change more fierce;
    From beds of raging fire to starve in ice
    Their soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine
    Immovable, infix'd, and frozen round,
    Periods of time; thence hurried back to fire.
_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 592._
    O'er many a frozen, many a fiery Alp,

                           The other shape,
    If shape it might be call'd that shape had none
    Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb;
    Or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd,
    For each seem'd either,--black it stood as night,
    Fierce as ten furies, terrible as hell,
    And shook a dreadful dart; what seem'd his head
    The likeness of a kingly crown had on.
    Satan was now at hand.
_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 666._
    Whence and what art thou, execrable shape?
_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 681._

    False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings.
_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 699._
    So spake the grisly Terror.
_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 704._
    Incens'd with indignation Satan stood
    Unterrify'd, and like a comet burn'd
    That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge
    In th' arctic sky, and from his horrid hair
    Shakes pestilence and war.
_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 707._

    Grew darker at their frown.
_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 719._
              I fled, and cry'd out, DEATH!
    Hell trembled at the hideous name, and sigh'd
    From all her caves, and back resounded, DEATH!
_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 787._
    Before mine eyes in opposition sits
    Grim Death, my son and foe.
_Paradise Lost. Book ii. Line 803._
                                    Death
    Grinn'd horrible a ghastly smile, to hear
    His famine should be fill'd.

                       Where eldest Night
    And Chaos, ancestors of Nature, hold
    Eternal anarchy amidst the noise
    Of endless wars, and by confusion stand;
    For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four champions fierce,
    Strive here for mast'ry.

    Hail holy light! offspring of heav'n first-born.
_Paradise Lost. Book iii. Line 1._

    Harmonious numbers.
_Paradise Lost. Book iii. Line 37._
                         Thus with the year
    Seasons return; but not to me returns
    Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,
    Or sight of vernal bloom or summer's rose,
    Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;
    But cloud instead, and ever-during dark
    Surrounds me; from the cheerful ways of men
    Cut off, and for the book of knowledge fair
    Presented with a universal blank
    Of Nature's works, to me expung'd and raz'd,
    And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.
_Paradise Lost. Book iii. Line 40._
Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.

    The hell within him.
_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 20._

    Of what he was, what is, and what must be
    Worse.
_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 23._

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 55._
                         Which way shall I fly
    Infinite wrath and infinite despair?
    Which way I fly is hell; myself am hell;
    And in the lowest deep a lower deep,
    Still threat'ning to devour me, opens wide,
    To which the hell I suffer seems a heaven.
_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 73._
    Such joy ambition finds.

    Now came still evening on, and twilight gray
    Had in her sober livery all things clad;
    Silence accompany'd; for beast and bird,
    They to their grassy couch, these to their nests,
    Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale;
    She all night long her amorous descant sung;
    Silence was pleas'd. Now glow'd the firmament
    With living sapphires; Hesperus, that led
    The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon,
    Rising in clouded majesty, at length
    Apparent queen unveil'd her peerless light,
    And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.
_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 598._
    The timely dew of sleep.
_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 614._
    With thee conversing I forget all time,
    All seasons, and their change,--all please alike.
    Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet,
    With charm of earliest birds; pleasant the sun
    When first on this delightful land he spreads
    His orient beams on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,
    Glist'ring with dew; fragrant the fertile earth
    After soft showers; and sweet the coming on
    Of grateful ev'ning mild; then silent night
    With this her solemn bird and this fair moon,
    And these the gems of heaven, her starry train:
    But neither breath of morn when she ascends
    With charm of earliest birds, nor rising sun
    On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, flower,
    Glist'ring with dew, nor fragrance after showers,
    Nor grateful ev'ning mild, nor silent night
    With this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon
    Or glittering starlight, without thee is sweet.
_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 639._
    Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth
    Unseen, both when we wake and when we sleep.

_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 800._
    Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear
    Touch'd lightly; for no falsehood can endure
    Touch of celestial temper.

    And felt how awful goodness is, and saw
    Virtue in her shape how lovely.

    Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.
_Paradise Lost. Book iv. Line 1014._
    Now morn, her rosy steps in th' eastern clime
    Advancing, sow'd the earth with orient pearl,

    Beauty, which, whether waking or asleep,

                              My latest found,
    Heaven's last, best gift, my ever new delight!
_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 18._
                          Good, the more
    Communicated, more abundant grows.
_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 71._
    These are thy glorious works, Parent of good!
_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 153._
    Fairest of stars, last in the train of night,
    If better thou belong not to the dawn.
_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 166._
    A wilderness of sweets.
_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 294._
                          Another morn
    Ris'n on mid-noon.
_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 310._

    She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent.
_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 331._

    Is heard no more in heaven.
_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 658._
          Midnight brought on the dusky hour
    Friendliest to sleep and silence.
_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 667._
    Innumerable as the stars of night,
    Or stars of morning, dewdrops which the sun
    Impearls on every leaf and every flower.
_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 745._
    So spake the seraph Abdiel, faithful found;
    Among the faithless, faithful only he.
_Paradise Lost. Book v. Line 896._
                                 Morn,
    Wak'd by the circling hours, with rosy hand
    Unbarr'd the gates of light.
_Paradise Lost. Book vi. Line 2._
    Servant of God, well done; well hast thou fought
    The better fight.
_Paradise Lost. Book vi. Line 29._
          Arms on armour clashing bray'd
    Horrible discord, and the madding wheels
    Of brazen chariots rag'd: dire was the noise
    Of conflict.
_Paradise Lost. Book vi. Line 209._
                  Spirits that live throughout,
    Vital in every part, not as frail man,
    In entrails, heart or head, liver or reins,
    Cannot but by annihilating die.
_Paradise Lost. Book vi. Line 345._

    On evil days though fall'n, and evil tongues.
_Paradise Lost. Book vii. Line 24._
                      Still govern thou my song,
    Urania, and fit audience find, though few.
_Paradise Lost. Book vii. Line 30._
                     Heaven open'd wide
    Her ever during gates, harmonious sound,
    On golden hinges moving.
_Paradise Lost. Book vii. Line 205._
    Hither, as to their fountain, other stars
    Repairing, in their golden urns draw light.

    And pavement stars,--as stars to thee appear
    Seen in the galaxy, that milky way
    Which nightly as a circling zone thou seest
    Powder'd with stars.
_Paradise Lost. Book vii. Line 577._
    The Angel ended, and in Adam's ear
    So charming left his voice, that he awhile
    Thought him still speaking, still stood fix'd to hear.
_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 1._

    With inoffensive pace, that spinning sleeps
    On her soft axle.
_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 163._
                           Be lowly wise:
    Think only what concerns thee and thy being.
_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 173._
                               To know
    That which before us lies in daily life
    Is the prime wisdom.

    Liquid lapse of murmuring streams.
_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 263._
    And feel that I am happier than I know.
_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 282._
    Among unequals what society
    Can sort, what harmony, or true delight?
_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 383._
    Grace was in all her steps, heaven in her eye,
    In every gesture dignity and love.
_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 488._
    Her virtue and the conscience of her worth,
    That would be woo'd, and not unsought be won.
_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 502._
                She what was honour knew,
    And with obsequious majesty approv'd
    My pleaded reason. To the nuptial bower
    I led her blushing like the morn; all heaven
    And happy constellations on that hour
    Shed their selectest influence; the earth
    Gave sign of gratulation, and each hill;
    Joyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs
    Whisper'd it to the woods, and from their wings
    Flung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrub.
_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 508._
    The sum of earthly bliss.
_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 522._
                           So well to know
    Her own, that what she wills to do or say
    Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best.
_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 548._
    Accuse not Nature: she hath done her part;
    Do thou but thine.
_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 561._
               Oft times nothing profits more
    Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right
    Well manag'd.
_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 571._
                            Those graceful acts,
    Those thousand decencies that daily flow
    From all her words and actions.
_Paradise Lost. Book viii. Line 600._
                          With a smile that glow'd
    Celestial rosy red, love's proper hue.

    Climate, or years, damp my intended wing.
_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 44._
              Revenge, at first though sweet,
    Bitter ere long back on itself recoils.
_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 171._
               The work under our labour grows,
    Luxurious by restraint.
_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 208._
                 Smiles from reason flow,
    To brute deny'd, and are of love the food.
_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 239._
    For solitude sometimes is best society,
    And short retirement urges sweet return.
_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 249._
    At shut of evening flowers.
_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 278._
    As one who long in populous city pent,
    Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air.
_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 445._
    So gloz'd the tempter.
_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 549._
                 Hope elevates, and joy
    Brightens his crest.
_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 633._
                      Left that command
    Sole daughter of his voice.
_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 652._
    Earth felt the wound; and Nature from her seat,
    Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe
    That all was lost.
_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 782._
                       In her face excuse
    Came prologue, and apology too prompt.
_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 853._
                          A pillar'd shade
    High overarch'd, and echoing walks between.
_Paradise Lost. Book ix. Line 1106._
                        Yet I shall temper so
    Justice with mercy, as may illustrate most
    Them fully satisfy'd, and thee appease.
_Paradise Lost. Book x. Line 77._
    So scented the grim Feature, and upturn'd
    His nostril wide into the murky air,
    Sagacious of his quarry from so far.
_Paradise Lost. Book x. Line 279._
                 How gladly would I meet
    Mortality my sentence, and be earth
    Insensible! how glad would lay me down
    As in my mother's lap!
_Paradise Lost. Book x. Line 775._
    Must I thus leave thee, Paradise?--thus leave
    Thee, native soil, these happy walks and shades?
_Paradise Lost. Book xi. Line 269._
          Then purg'd with euphrasy and rue
    The visual nerve, for he had much to see.
_Paradise Lost. Book xi. Line 414._

    And moon-struck madness.
_Paradise Lost. Book xi. Line 485._
    And over them triumphant Death his dart
    Shook, but delay'd to strike, though oft invok'd.
_Paradise Lost. Book xi. Line 491._
    So may'st thou live, till like ripe fruit thou drop
    Into thy mother's lap.
_Paradise Lost. Book xi. Line 535._
    Nor love thy life, nor hate; but what thou liv'st
    Live well: how long or short permit to heaven.
_Paradise Lost. Book xi. Line 553._
    A bevy of fair women.
_Paradise Lost. Book xi. Line 582._
    The brazen throat of war.
_Paradise Lost. Book xi. Line 713._
    Some natural tears they dropp'd, but wip'd them soon;
    The world was all before them, where to choose
    Their place of rest, and Providence their guide.
    They hand in hand, with wand'ring steps and slow,
    Through Eden took their solitary way.
_Paradise Lost. Book xii. Line 645._
                        Beauty stands
    In the admiration only of weak minds
    Led captive.
_Paradise Regained. Book ii. Line 220._
    Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wreck'd.

            The childhood shows the man,
    As morning shows the day.
_Paradise Regained. Book iv. Line 220._
    Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of arts
    And eloquence.
_Paradise Regained. Book iv. Line 240._
                  The olive grove of Academe,
    Plato's retirement, where the Attic bird
    Trills her thick-warbled notes the summer long.
_Paradise Regained. Book iv. Line 244._
    Thence to the famous orators repair,
    Those ancient, whose resistless eloquence
    Wielded at will that fierce democratie,
    Shook the arsenal, and fulmin'd over Greece,
    To Macedon, and Artaxerxes' throne.
_Paradise Regained. Book iv. Line 267._
    Socrates . . .
    Whom well inspir'd the oracle pronounc'd
    Wisest of men.
_Paradise Regained. Book iv. Line 274._
    Deep vers'd in books, and shallow in himself.
_Paradise Regained. Book iv. Line 327._
    As children gath'ring pebbles on the shore.
    Or if I would delight my private hours
    With music or with poem, where so soon
    As in our native language can I find
    That solace?
_Paradise Regained. Book iv. Line 330._
                     Till morning fair
    Came forth with pilgrim steps in amice gray.
_Paradise Regained. Book iv. Line 426._
    O dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon,
    Irrecoverably dark, total eclipse
    Without all hope of day!
_Samson Agonistes. Line 80._
    The sun to me is dark
    And silent as the moon,
    When she deserts the night
    Hid in her vacant interlunar cave.
_Samson Agonistes. Line 86._
    Ran on embattled armies clad in iron,
    And, weaponless himself,
    Made arms ridiculous.
_Samson Agonistes. Line 129._
    Just are the ways of God,
    And justifiable to men;
    Unless there be who think not God at all.
_Samson Agonistes. Line 293._
    What boots it at one gate to make defence,
    And at another to let in the foe?
_Samson Agonistes. Line 560._
    But who is this, what thing of sea or land,
    Female of sex it seems,
    That so bedeck'd, ornate, and gay,
    Comes this way sailing
    Like a stately ship
    Of Tarsus, bound for th' isles
    Of Javan or Gadire,
    With all her bravery on, and tackle trim,
    Sails fill'd, and streamers waving,
    Courted by all the winds that hold them play,
    An amber scent of odorous perfume
    Her harbinger?
_Samson Agonistes. Line 710._
    Yet beauty, though injurious, hath strange power,
    After offence returning, to regain
    Love once possess'd.
_Samson Agonistes. Line 1003._
    He 's gone, and who knows how he may report
    Thy words by adding fuel to the flame?
_Samson Agonistes. Line 1350._
    For evil news rides post, while good news baits.
_Samson Agonistes. Line 1538._
    And as an ev'ning dragon came,
    Assailant on the perched roosts
    And nests in order rang'd
    Of tame villatic fowl.
_Samson Agonistes. Line 1692._
    Nothing is here for tears, nothing to wail
    Or knock the breast, no weakness, no contempt,
    Dispraise, or blame,--nothing but well and fair,
    And what may quiet us in a death so noble.
_Samson Agonistes. Line 1721._
    Above the smoke and stir of this dim spot
    Which men call earth.
_Comus. Line 5._
                          That golden key
    That opes the palace of eternity.
_Comus. Line 13._
    The nodding horror of whose shady brows
    Threats the forlorn and wandering passenger.
_Comus. Line 38._
                        I will tell you now
    What never yet was heard in tale or song,
    From old or modern bard, in hall or bower.

    Bacchus, that first from out the purple grape
    Crush'd the sweet poison of misused wine.
_Comus. Line 46._
    These my sky-robes spun out of Iris' woof.
_Comus. Line 83._
    The star that bids the shepherd fold.
_Comus. Line 93._
    Midnight shout and revelry,
    Tipsy dance and jollity.
_Comus. Line 103._
    Ere the blabbing eastern scout,
    The nice morn, on th' Indian steep
    From her cabin'd loop-hole peep.
_Comus. Line 138._
                    When the gray-hooded Even,
    Like a sad votarist in palmer's weed,
    Rose from the hindmost wheels of Phoebus' wain.
_Comus. Line 188._
                 A thousand fantasies
    Begin to throng into my memory,
    Of calling shapes, and beck'ning shadows dire,
    And airy tongues that syllable men's names
    On sands and shores and desert wildernesses.
_Comus. Line 205._
    O welcome, pure-ey'd Faith, white-handed Hope,
    Thou hovering angel, girt with golden wings!
_Comus. Line 213._
    Was I deceiv'd, or did a sable cloud
    Turn forth her silver lining on the night?
_Comus. Line 221._
    Can any mortal mixture of earth's mould
    Breathe such divine enchanting ravishment?
_Comus. Line 244._
    How sweetly did they float upon the wings
    Of silence through the empty-vaulted night,
    At every fall smoothing the raven down
    Of darkness till it smil'd!
_Comus. Line 249._
    Who, as they sung, would take the prison'd soul
    And lap it in Elysium.
_Comus. Line 256._
    Such sober certainty of waking bliss.
_Comus. Line 263._
    I took it for a faery vision
    Of some gay creatures of the element,
    That in the colours of the rainbow live,
    And play i' th' plighted clouds.
_Comus. Line 298._
    It were a journey like the path to heaven,
    To help you find them.
_Comus. Line 303._
    With thy long levell'd rule of streaming light.
_Comus. Line 340._
    Virtue could see to do what virtue would
    By her own radiant light, though sun and moon
    Were in the flat sea sunk. And Wisdom's self
    Oft seeks to sweet retired solitude,
    Where with her best nurse Contemplation
    She plumes her feathers and lets grow her wings,
    That in the various bustle of resort
    Were all-to ruffled, and sometimes impair'd.
    He that has light within his own clear breast
    May sit i' th' centre and enjoy bright day;
    But he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts
    Benighted walks under the midday sun.
_Comus. Line 373._
                           The unsunn'd heaps
    Of miser's treasure.
_Comus. Line 398._
    'T is chastity, my brother, chastity:
    She that has that is clad in complete steel.
_Comus. Line 420._
    Some say no evil thing that walks by night,
    In fog or fire, by lake or moorish fen,
    Blue meagre hag, or stubborn unlaid ghost
    That breaks his magic chains at curfew time,
    No goblin, or swart fairy of the mine,
    Hath hurtful power o'er true virginity.
_Comus. Line 432._
    So dear to heav'n is saintly chastity,
    That when a soul is found sincerely so,
    A thousand liveried angels lackey her,
    Driving far off each thing of sin and guilt,
    And in clear dream and solemn vision
    Tell her of things that no gross ear can hear,
    Till oft converse with heav'nly habitants
    Begin to cast a beam on th' outward shape.
_Comus. Line 453._
    How charming is divine philosophy!
    Not harsh and crabbed, as dull fools suppose,
    But musical as is Apollo's lute,
    And a perpetual feast of nectar'd sweets
    Where no crude surfeit reigns.
_Comus. Line 476._
    And sweeten'd every musk-rose of the dale.

    And took in strains that might create a soul
    Under the ribs of death.
_Comus. Line 560._
                           That power
    Which erring men call Chance.
_Comus. Line 587._
                               If this fail,
    The pillar'd firmament is rottenness,

_Comus. Line 597._
    The leaf was darkish, and had prickles on it,
    But in another country, as he said,
    Bore a bright golden flow'r, but not in this soil;
    Unknown, and like esteem'd, and the dull swain
    Treads on it daily with his clouted shoon.

    It is for homely features to keep home,
    They had their name thence; coarse complexions
    And cheeks of sorry grain will serve to ply
    The sampler and to tease the huswife's wool.
    What need a vermeil-tinctur'd lip for that,
    Love-darting eyes, or tresses like the morn?
_Comus. Line 748._
                            Swinish gluttony
    Ne'er looks to heav'n amidst his gorgeous feast,
    But with besotted base ingratitude
    Crams, and blasphemes his feeder.
_Comus. Line 776._
    Enjoy your dear wit and gay rhetoric,
    That hath so well been taught her dazzling fence.
_Comus. Line 790._
                           His rod revers'd,
    And backward mutters of dissevering power.
_Comus. Line 816._
    Sabrina fair,
      Listen where thou art sitting
    Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,
      In twisted braids of lilies knitting
    The loose train of thy amber-dropping hair.
_Comus. Line 859._
    But now my task is smoothly done,
    I can fly, or I can run.
_Comus. Line 1012._
    Or if Virtue feeble were,
    Heav'n itself would stoop to her.
_Comus. Line 1022._
    I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude,
    And with forc'd fingers rude
    Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year.
_Lycidas. Line 3._
                                He knew
    Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.
_Lycidas. Line 10._
    Without the meed of some melodious tear.
_Lycidas. Line 14._
    Under the opening eyelids of the morn.
_Lycidas. Line 26._
    But oh the heavy change, now thou art gone,
    Now thou art gone and never must return!
_Lycidas. Line 37._
    The gadding vine.
_Lycidas. Line 40._
    And strictly meditate the thankless Muse.
_Lycidas. Line 66._
    To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,
    Or with the tangles of Neæra's hair.
_Lycidas. Line 68._
    Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise
    (That last infirmity of noble mind)
    To scorn delights, and live laborious days;
    But the fair guerdon when we hope to find,
    And think to burst out into sudden blaze,
    Comes the blind Fury with th' abhorred shears
    And slits the thin-spun life.
_Lycidas. Line 70._
    Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil.
_Lycidas. Line 78._
    It was that fatal and perfidious bark,
    Built in th' eclipse, and rigg'd with curses dark.
_Lycidas. Line 100._
    The pilot of the Galilean lake;
    Two massy keys he bore, of metals twain
    (The golden opes, the iron shuts amain).
_Lycidas. Line 109._
    But that two-handed engine at the door
    Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more.
_Lycidas. Line 130._
    Throw hither all your quaint enamell'd eyes
    That on the green turf suck the honied showers,
    And purple all the ground with vernal flowers.
    Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies,
    The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine,
    The white pink, and the pansy freakt with jet,
    The glowing violet,
    The musk-rose, and the well-attir'd woodbine,
    With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,
    And every flower that sad embroidery wears.
_Lycidas. Line 139._
    So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed,
    And yet anon repairs his drooping head,
    And tricks his beams, and with new-spangled ore
    Flames in the forehead of the morning sky.
_Lycidas. Line 168._
    He touch'd the tender stops of various quills,
    With eager thought warbling his Doric lay.
_Lycidas. Line 188._
    To-morrow to fresh woods and pastures new.
_Lycidas. Line 193._
    Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee
    Jest and youthful Jollity,
    Quips and Cranks and wanton Wiles,
    Nods and Becks and wreathed Smiles.
_L'Allegro. Line 25._
    Sport, that wrinkled Care derides,
    And Laughter holding both his sides.
    Come and trip it as ye go,
    On the light fantastic toe.
_L'Allegro. Line 31._
    The mountain nymph, sweet Liberty.
_L'Allegro. Line 36._
    And every shepherd tells his tale
    Under the hawthorn in the dale.
_L'Allegro. Line 67._
    Meadows trim with daisies pied,
    Shallow brooks and rivers wide;
    Towers and battlements it sees
    Bosom'd high in tufted trees,
    Where perhaps some beauty lies,
    The cynosure of neighboring eyes.
_L'Allegro. Line 75._
    Herbs, and other country messes,
    Which the neat-handed Phillis dresses.
_L'Allegro. Line 85._
    To many a youth and many a maid
    Dancing in the chequer'd shade.
_L'Allegro. Line 95._
    Then to the spicy nut-brown ale.
_L'Allegro. Line 100._
    Tower'd cities please us then,
    And the busy hum of men.
_L'Allegro. Line 117._
               Ladies, whose bright eyes
    Rain influence, and judge the prize.
_L'Allegro. Line 121._
    Such sights as youthful poets dream
    On summer eyes by haunted stream.
    Then to the well-trod stage anon,
    If Jonson's learned sock be on,
    Or sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy's child,
    Warble his native wood-notes wild.
_L'Allegro. Line 129._
    And ever against eating cares
    Lap me in soft Lydian airs,
    Married to immortal verse,
    Such as the meeting soul may pierce,
    In notes with many a winding bout
    Of linked sweetness long drawn out.
_L'Allegro. Line 135._
    Untwisting all the chains that tie
    The hidden soul of harmony.
_L'Allegro. Line 143._
    The gay motes that people the sunbeams.
_Il Penseroso. Line 8._
    And looks commercing with the skies,
    Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes.
_Il Penseroso. Line 39._
    Forget thyself to marble.
_Il Penseroso. Line 42._
    And join with thee calm Peace and Quiet,
    Spare Fast, that oft with gods doth diet.
_Il Penseroso. Line 45._
    And add to these retired Leisure,
    That in trim gardens takes his pleasure.
_Il Penseroso. Line 49._
    Sweet bird, that shun'st the noise of folly,
    Most musical, most melancholy!
_Il Penseroso. Line 61._
                  I walk unseen
    On the dry smooth-shaven green,
    To behold the wandering moon
    Riding near her highest noon,
    Like one that had been led astray
    Through the heav'n's wide pathless way;
    And oft, as if her head she bow'd,
    Stooping through a fleecy cloud.
_Il Penseroso. Line 65._
    Where glowing embers through the room
    Teach light to counterfeit a gloom.
_Il Penseroso. Line 79._
    Far from all resort of mirth
    Save the cricket on the hearth.
_Il Penseroso. Line 81._
    Sometime let gorgeous Tragedy
    In sceptred pall come sweeping by,
    Presenting Thebes, or Pelops' line,
    Or the tale of Troy divine.
_Il Penseroso. Line 97._
    Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing
    Such notes as, warbled to the string,
    Drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek.
_Il Penseroso. Line 105._
    Or call up him that left half told
    The story of Cambuscan bold.
_Il Penseroso. Line 109._
    Where more is meant than meets the ear.
_Il Penseroso. Line 120._
    When the gust hath blown his fill,
    Ending on the rustling leaves
    With minute drops from off the eaves.
_Il Penseroso. Line 128._
    Hide me from day's garish eye.
_Il Penseroso. Line 141._
    And storied windows richly dight,
    Casting a dim religious light.
_Il Penseroso. Line 159._
    Till old experience do attain
    To something like prophetic strain.
_Il Penseroso. Line 173._
    Such sweet compulsion doth in music lie.
_Arcades. Line 68._
    Under the shady roof
    Of branching elm star-proof.
_Arcades. Line 88._
    O fairest flower! no sooner blown but blasted,
    Soft silken primrose fading timelessly.
_Ode on the Death of a fair Infant, dying of a Cough._
    Such as may make thee search the coffers round.
_At a Vacation Exercise. Line 31._
    No war or battle's sound
    Was heard the world around.
_Hymn on Christ's Nativity. Line 53._
    Time will run back and fetch the age of gold.
_Hymn on Christ's Nativity. Line 135._
    Swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail.
_Hymn on Christ's Nativity. Line 172._
          The oracles are dumb,
          No voice or hideous hum
    Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving.
          Apollo from his shrine
          Can no more divine,
    With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving.
    No nightly trance or breathed spell
    Inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetic cell.
_Hymn on Christ's Nativity. Line 173._
    From haunted spring and dale
    Edg'd with poplar pale
    The parting genius is with sighing sent.
_Hymn on Christ's Nativity. Line 184._
    Peor and Baälim
    Forsake their temples dim.
_Hymn on Christ's Nativity. Line 197._
    What needs my Shakespeare for his honour'd bones,
    The labour of an age in piled stones?
    Or that his hallow'd relics should be hid
    Under a star-y-pointing pyramid?
    Dear son of memory, great heir of fame,
    What need'st thou such weak witness of thy name?
_Epitaph on Shakespeare._
    And so sepúlchred in such pomp dost lie,
    That kings for such a tomb would wish to die.
_Epitaph on Shakespeare._
    Thy liquid notes that close the eye of day.
_Sonnet to the Nightingale._
    As ever in my great Taskmaster's eye.

    What neat repast shall feast us, light and choice,
    Of Attic taste?
_To Mr. Lawrence._
    In mirth that after no repenting draws.
_Sonnet xxi. To Cyriac Skinner._
    For other things mild Heav'n a time ordains,
    And disapproves that care, though wise in show,
    That with superfluous burden loads the day,
    And when God sends a cheerful hour, refrains.
_Sonnet xxi. To Cyriac Skinner._
                       Yet I argue not
    Against Heav'n's hand or will, nor bate a jot
    Of heart or hope; but still bear up and steer
    Right onward.
_Sonnet xxii. To Cyriac Skinner._
    Of which all Europe rings from side to side.
_Sonnet xxii. To Cyriac Skinner._
    But oh! as to embrace me she inclin'd,
    I wak'd, she fled, and day brought back my night.
_On his Deceased Wife._
                    Have hung
    My dank and dropping weeds
    To the stern god of sea.
_Translation of Horace. Book i. Ode 5._
     For such kind of borrowing as this, if it be not bettered by the
     borrower, among good authors is accounted Plagiarè.
_Iconoclastes. xxiii._
     Truth is as impossible to be soiled by any outward touch as the
     sunbeam.
_Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce._
     A poet soaring in the high reason of his fancies, with his
     garland and singing robes about him.
_The Reason of Church Government. Introduction, Book ii._
     By labour and intent study (which I take to be my portion in this
     life), joined with the strong propensity of nature, I might
     perhaps leave something so written to after times as they should
     not willingly let it die.
_The Reason of Church Government. Introduction, Book ii._
     Beholding the bright countenance of truth in the quiet and still
     air of delightful studies.
_The Reason of Church Government. Introduction, Book ii._
     He who would not be frustrate of his hope to write well hereafter
     in laudable things ought himself to be a true poem.
_Apology for Smectymnuus._
     His words, like so many nimble and airy servitors, trip about him
     at command.
_Apology for Smectymnuus._
     Litigious terms, fat contentions, and flowing fees.
_Tractate of Education._
     I shall detain you no longer in the demonstration of what we
     should not do, but straight conduct ye to a hillside, where I
     will point ye out the right path of a virtuous and noble
     education; laborious indeed at the first ascent, but else so
     smooth, so green, so full of goodly prospect and melodious sounds
     on every side that the harp of Orpheus was not more charming.
_Tractate of Education._
     Enflamed with the study of learning and the admiration of virtue;
     stirred up with high hopes of living to be brave men and worthy
     patriots, dear to God, and famous to all ages.
_Tractate of Education._
     Ornate rhetorick taught out of the rule of Plato. . . . To which
     poetry would be made subsequent, or indeed rather precedent, as
     being less suttle and fine, but more simple, sensuous, and
     passionate.
_Tractate of Education._
     In those vernal seasons of the year, when the air is calm and
     pleasant, it were an injury and sullenness against Nature not to
     go out and see her riches, and partake in her rejoicing with
     heaven and earth.
_Tractate of Education._
     Attic tragedies of stateliest and most regal argument.
_Tractate of Education._
     As good almost kill a man as kill a good book: who kills a man
     kills a reasonable creature, God's image; but he who destroys a
     good book kills reason itself.
_Areopagitica._
     A good book is the precious life-blood of a master-spirit,
     embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life.
_Areopagitica._
     Seasoned life of man preserved and stored up in books.
_Areopagitica._
     I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue, unexercised and
     unbreathed, that never sallies out and sees her adversary, but
     slinks out of the race where that immortal garland is to be run
     for, not without dust and heat.
_Areopagitica._
     Who shall silence all the airs and madrigals that whisper
     softness in chambers?
_Areopagitica._
     Methinks I see in my mind a noble and puissant nation rousing
     herself like a strong man after sleep, and shaking her invincible
     locks; methinks I see her as an eagle mewing her mighty youth,
     and kindling her undazzled eyes at the full midday beam.
_Areopagitica._
     Though all the winds of doctrine were let loose to play upon the
     earth, so Truth be in the field, we do ingloriously, by licensing
     and prohibiting, to misdoubt her strength. Let her and Falsehood
     grapple: who ever knew Truth put to the worse in a free and open
     encounter?
_Areopagitica._
     Men of most renowned virtue have sometimes by transgressing most
     truly kept the law.
_Tetrachordon._
     By this time, like one who had set out on his way by night, and
     travelled through a region of smooth or idle dreams, our history
     now arrives on the confines, where daylight and truth meet us
     with a clear dawn, representing to our view, though at a far
     distance, true colours and shapes.
_The History of England. Book i._
     Such bickerings to recount, met often in these our writers, what
     more worth is it than to chronicle the wars of kites or crows
     flocking and fighting in the air?
_The History of England. Book iv._
EDWARD HYDE CLARENDON. 1608-1674.
     He [Hampden] had a head to contrive, a tongue to persuade, and a
     hand to execute any mischief.
_History of the Rebellion. Vol. iii. Book vii. § 84._
SIR JOHN SUCKLING. 1609-1641.
    Her feet beneath her petticoat
    Like little mice stole in and out,
      As if they feared the light;
    But oh, she dances such a way!
    No sun upon an Easter-day
      Is half so fine a sight.
_Ballad upon a Wedding._
    Her lips were red, and one was thin;
    Compared with that was next her chin,
    Some bee had stung it newly.
_Ballad upon a Wedding._
    Why so pale and wan, fond lover?
        Prithee, why so pale?
    Will, when looking well can't move her,
        Looking ill prevail?
        Prithee, why so pale?
_Song._
    'T is expectation makes a blessing dear;
    Heaven were not heaven if we knew what it were.
_Against Fruition._
    She is pretty to walk with,
    And witty to talk with,
    And pleasant, too, to think on.
_Brennoralt. Act ii._
    Her face is like the milky way i' the sky,
    A meeting of gentle lights without a name.
_Brennoralt. Act iii._
    But as when an authentic watch is shown,
    Each man winds up and rectifies his own,
    So in our very judgments.
_Aglaura. Epilogue._
    The prince of darkness is a gentleman.
_The Goblins._
    Nick of time.

    Things that ne'er were, nor are, nor e'er will be.
_The Goblins. Epilogue._
MARQUIS OF MONTROSE. 1612-1650.
    He either fears his fate too much,
      Or his deserts are small,
    That dares not put it to the touch
      To gain or lose it all.
_My Dear and only Love._
    I 'll make thee glorious by my pen,
      And famous by my sword.
_My Dear and only Love._
SIR JOHN DENHAM. 1615-1668.
    Though with those streams he no resemblance hold,
    Whose foam is amber and their gravel gold;
    His genuine and less guilty wealth t' explore,
    Search not his bottom, but survey his shore.
_Cooper's Hill. Line 165._
    Oh, could I flow like thee, and make thy stream
    My great example, as it is my theme!
    Though deep, yet clear; though gentle, yet not dull;
    Strong without rage; without o'erflowing, full.
_Cooper's Hill. Line 189._
     Actions of the last age are like almanacs of the last year.
_The Sophy. A Tragedy._
    But whither am I strayed? I need not raise
    Trophies to thee from other men's dispraise;
    Nor is thy fame on lesser ruins built;
    Nor needs thy juster title the foul guilt
    Of Eastern kings, who, to secure their reign,
    Must have their brothers, sons, and kindred slain.
_On Mr. John Fletcher's Works._
RICHARD CRASHAW. _Circa_ 1616-1650.
    The conscious water saw its God and blushed.
_Epigram._
    Whoe'er she be,
    That not impossible she,
    That shall command my heart and me.
_Wishes to his Supposed Mistress._
    Where'er she lie,
    Locked up from mortal eye,
    In shady leaves of destiny.
_Wishes to his Supposed Mistress._
    Days that need borrow
    No part of their good morrow
    From a fore-spent night of sorrow.
_Wishes to his Supposed Mistress._
    Life that dares send
    A challenge to his end,
    And when it comes, say, Welcome, friend!
_Wishes to his Supposed Mistress._
    Sydneian showers
    Of sweet discourse, whose powers
    Can crown old Winter's head with flowers.
_Wishes to his Supposed Mistress._
    A happy soul, that all the way
    To heaven hath a summer's day.
_In Praise of Lessius's Rule of Health._
    The modest front of this small floor,
    Believe me, reader, can say more
    Than many a braver marble can,
    "Here lies a truly honest man!"
_Epitaph upon Mr. Ashton._
RICHARD LOVELACE. 1618-1658.
    Oh, could you view the melody
      Of every grace
      And music of her face,
    You 'd drop a tear;
      Seeing more harmony
      In her bright eye
    Than now you hear.
_Orpheus to Beasts._
    I could not love thee, dear, so much,
      Lov'd I not honour more.
_To Lucasta, on going to the Wars._
    When flowing cups pass swiftly round
      With no allaying Thames.
_To Althea from Prison, ii._
    Fishes that tipple in the deep,
      Know no such liberty.
_To Althea from Prison, ii._
    Stone walls do not a prison make,
      Nor iron bars a cage;
    Minds innocent and quiet take
      That for an hermitage;
    If I have freedom in my love,
      And in my soul am free,
    Angels alone that soar above
      Enjoy such liberty.
_To Althea from Prison, iv._
ABRAHAM COWLEY. 1618-1667.
    What shall I do to be forever known,
    And make the age to come my own?
_The Motto._
    His time is forever, everywhere his place.
_Friendship in Absence._
    We spent them not in toys, in lusts, or wine,
        But search of deep philosophy,
        Wit, eloquence, and poetry;
    Arts which I lov'd, for they, my friend, were thine.
_On the Death of Mr. William Harvey._
    His _faith_, perhaps, in some nice tenets might
    Be wrong; his _life_, I 'm sure, was in the right.
_On the Death of Crashaw._
    The thirsty earth soaks up the rain,
    And drinks, and gapes for drink again;
    The plants suck in the earth, and are
    With constant drinking fresh and fair.
_From Anacreon, ii. Drinking._
    Fill all the glasses there, for why
    Should every creature drink but I?
    Why, man of morals, tell me why?
_From Anacreon, ii. Drinking._
    A mighty pain to love it is,
    And 't is a pain that pain to miss;
    But of all pains, the greatest pain
    It is to love, but love in vain.
_From Anacreon, vii. Gold._
    Hope, of all ills that men endure,
    The only cheap and universal cure.
_The Mistress. For Hope._
    Th' adorning thee with so much art
      Is but a barb'rous skill;
    'T is like the pois'ning of a dart,
      Too apt before to kill.
_The Waiting Maid._
    Nothing is there to come, and nothing past,
    But an eternal now does always last.
_Davideis. Book i. Line 25._
    When Israel was from bondage led,
      Led by the Almighty's hand
      From out of foreign land,
    The great sea beheld and fled.
_Davideis. Book i. Line 41._
    An harmless flaming meteor shone for hair,
    And fell adown his shoulders with loose care.
_Davideis. Book ii. Line 95._
    The monster London laugh at me.
_Of Solitude, xi._
    Let but thy wicked men from out thee go,
    And all the fools that crowd thee so,
    Even thou, who dost thy millions boast,
    A village less than Islington wilt grow,
    A solitude almost.
_Of Solitude, vii._
    The fairest garden in her looks,
    And in her mind the wisest books.
_The Garden, i._
    God the first garden made, and the first city Cain.
_The Garden, ii._
    Hence, ye profane! I hate ye all,
    Both the great vulgar and the small.
_Horace. Book iii. Ode 1._
    Charm'd with the foolish whistling of a name.
_Virgil, Georgics. Book ii. Line 72._
    Words that weep and tears that speak.
_The Prophet._
    We griev'd, we sigh'd, we wept; we never blush'd before.
_Discourse concerning the Government of Oliver Cromwell._
    Thus would I double my life's fading space;
    For he that runs it well, runs twice his race.

JOSEPH HENSHAW.[263-1] ---- -1678.
    Man's life is like unto a winter's day,
    Some break their fast and so depart away;
    Others stay dinner, then depart full fed;
    The longest age but sups and goes to bed.

    Bright shoots of everlastingness.
_The Retreat._
    I see them walking in an air of glory
      Whose light doth trample on my days,
    My days, which are at best but dull and hoary,
      Mere glimmering and decays.
_They are all gone._
    Dear, beauteous death, the jewel of the just!
      Shining nowhere but in the dark;
    What mysteries do lie beyond thy dust,
      Could man outlook that mark!
_They are all gone._
    And yet, as angels in some brighter dreams
    Call to the soul when man doth sleep,
    So some strange thoughts transcend our wonted themes,
    And into glory peep.
_They are all gone._
    Then bless thy secret growth, nor catch
    At noise, but thrive unseen and dumb;
    Keep clean, be as fruit, earn life, and watch
    Till the white-wing'd reapers come!

_Memoirs. Vol. ii. p. 255._
     When all is done, human life is, at the greatest and the best,

_Absalom and Achitophel. Part i. Line 27._
    A fiery soul, which, working out its way,
    Fretted the pygmy-body to decay,
    And o'er-inform'd the tenement of clay.
    A daring pilot in extremity;
    Pleas'd with the danger, when the waves went high
    He sought the storms.
_Absalom and Achitophel. Part i. Line 156._
    Great wits are sure to madness near allied,
    And thin partitions do their bounds divide.

    A man so various, that he seem'd to be
    Not one, but all mankind's epitome;

_On the Death of a very young Gentleman._
    Three poets, in three distant ages born,
    Greece, Italy, and England did adorn.
    The first in loftiness of thought surpass'd;
    The next, in majesty; in both the last.
    The force of Nature could no further go;
    To make a third, she join'd the former two.
_Under Mr. Milton's Picture._
    From harmony, from heavenly harmony,

_Alexander's Feast. Line 66._
    Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen,
    Fallen from his high estate,
      And welt'ring in his blood;

    By those his former bounty fed,
    On the bare earth expos'd he lies,
    With not a friend to close his eyes.
_Alexander's Feast. Line 77._
    For pity melts the mind to love.
_Alexander's Feast. Line 96._
    Softly sweet, in Lydian measures,
    Soon he sooth'd his soul to pleasures.
    War, he sung, is toil and trouble;
    Honour but an empty bubble;
      Never ending, still beginning,
    Fighting still, and still destroying.
      If all the world be worth the winning,
    Think, oh think it worth enjoying:
      Lovely Thais sits beside thee,
      Take the good the gods provide thee.
_Alexander's Feast. Line 97._

    Sex to the last.
_Cymon and Iphigenia. Line 367._
    And raw in fields the rude militia swarms,
    Mouths without hands; maintain'd at vast expense,
    In peace a charge, in war a weak defence;
    Stout once a month they march, a blustering band,
    And ever but in times of need at hand.
_Cymon and Iphigenia. Line 400._
    Of seeming arms to make a short essay,
    Then hasten to be drunk,--the business of the day.
_Cymon and Iphigenia. Line 407._
    Happy who in his verse can gently steer
    From grave to light, from pleasant to severe.
_The Art of Poetry. Canto i. Line 75._
    Happy the man, and happy he alone,
      He who can call to-day his own;
      He who, secure within, can say,
    To-morrow, do thy worst, for I have liv'd to-day.
_Imitation of Horace. Book iii. Ode 29, Line 65._
    Not heaven itself upon the past has power;
    But what has been, has been, and I have had my hour.
_Imitation of Horace. Book iii. Ode 29, Line 71._

_Persius. Satire v. Line 246._
    Look round the habitable world: how few
    Know their own good, or knowing it, pursue.
_Juvenal. Satire x._
    Our souls sit close and silently within,
    And their own web from their own entrails spin;
    And when eyes meet far off, our sense is such,
    That, spider-like, we feel the tenderest touch.

    Death in itself is nothing; but we fear
    To be we know not what, we know not where.
_Aurengzebe. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    When I consider life, 't is all a cheat.
    Yet fool'd with hope, men favour the deceit;
    Trust on, and think to-morrow will repay.
    To-morrow 's falser than the former day;
    Lies worse, and while it says we shall be blest
    With some new joys, cuts off what we possest.
    Strange cozenage! none would live past years again,
    Yet all hope pleasure in what yet remain;
    And from the dregs of life think to receive
    What the first sprightly running could not give.

_OEdipus. Act iii. Sc. 1._
    Of no distemper, of no blast he died,
    But fell like autumn fruit that mellow'd long,
    Even wonder'd at, because he dropp'd no sooner.
    Fate seem'd to wind him up for fourscore years,
    Yet freshly ran he on ten winters more;
    Till like a clock worn out with eating time,
    The wheels of weary life at last stood still.
_OEdipus. Act iv. Sc. 1._
    She, though in full-blown flower of glorious beauty,
    Grows cold even in the summer of her age.

ISAAC NEWTON. 1642-1727.
     I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I
     seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and

     prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay
     all undiscovered before me.

    O woman! lovely woman! Nature made thee
    To temper man: we had been brutes without you.

    Back on herself, and startles at destruction?
    'T is the divinity that stirs within us;
    'T is Heaven itself that points out an hereafter,
    And intimates eternity to man.
    Eternity! thou pleasing, dreadful thought!
_Cato. Act v. Sc. 1._
    I 'm weary of conjectures,--this must end 'em.
    Thus am I doubly armed: my death and life,
    My bane and antidote, are both before me:
    This in a moment brings me to an end;
    But this informs me I shall never die.
    The soul, secured in her existence, smiles
    At the drawn dagger, and defies its point.
    The stars shall fade away, the sun himself
    Grow dim with age, and Nature sink in years;
    But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth,
    Unhurt amidst the war of elements,
    The wrecks of matter, and the crush of worlds.

    For wheresoe'er I turn my ravish'd eyes,
    Gay gilded scenes and shining prospects rise,
    Poetic fields encompass me around,
    And still I seem to tread on classic ground.

    The spacious firmament on high,
    With all the blue ethereal sky,

_Ode._
    Soon as the evening shades prevail,
    The moon takes up the wondrous tale,
    And nightly to the listening earth
    Repeats the story of her birth;
    While all the stars that round her burn,
    And all the planets in their turn,
    Confirm the tidings as they roll,
    And spread the truth from pole to pole.
_Ode._
    For ever singing as they shine,
    The hand that made us is divine.
_Ode._
    Should the whole frame of Nature round him break,
    In ruin and confusion hurled,
    He, unconcerned, would hear the mighty crack,
    And stand secure amidst a falling world.
_Horace. Ode iii. Book iii._
    In all thy humours, whether grave or mellow,
    Thou 'rt such a touchy, testy, pleasant fellow,

ISAAC WATTS. 1674-1748.
    Whene'er I take my walks abroad,
      How many poor I see!

_Divine Songs. Song iv._
    A flower, when offered in the bud,

    And he that does one fault at first
      And lies to hide it, makes it two.

    Let bears and lions growl and fight,
      For 't is their nature too.

    Your little hands were never made
      To tear each other's eyes.
_Divine Songs. Song xvi._

    When children of one family
      Fall out, and chide, and fight.

     The balance of power.
_Speech, 1741._

     think,--that history is philosophy teaching by examples.

     The dignity of history.
_On the Study and Use of History. Letter v._
     It is the modest, not the presumptuous, inquirer who makes a real

     Nature and Nature's God; that is, he follows God in his works and
     in his word.
_Letter to Mr. Pope._
GEORGE FARQUHAR. 1678-1707.
     _Cos._ Pray now, what may be that same bed of honour?

    Her leaden sceptre o'er a slumbering world.

    The chamber where the good man meets his fate

_Night Thoughts. Night iii. Line 63._
                       Beautiful as sweet,
    And young as beautiful, and soft as young,

    Men may live fools, but fools they cannot die.
_Night Thoughts. Night iv. Line 843._
    By night an atheist half believes a God.
_Night Thoughts. Night v. Line 177._
    Early, bright, transient, chaste as morning dew,
    She sparkled, was exhal'd and went to heaven.
_Night Thoughts. Night v. Line 600._
    We see time's furrows on another's brow,

    Our wishes lengthen as our sun declines.

    The man of wisdom is the man of years.
_Night Thoughts. Night v. Line 775._
    Death loves a shining mark, a signal blow.
_Night Thoughts. Night v. Line 1011._
    Pygmies are pygmies still, though percht on Alps;
    And pyramids are pyramids in vales.
    Each man makes his own stature, builds himself.
    Virtue alone outbuilds the Pyramids;
    Her monuments shall last when Egypt's fall.

    Think naught a trifle, though it small appear;
    Small sands the mountain, moments make the year,
    And trifles life.
_Love of Fame. Satire vi. Line 208._
    One to destroy is murder by the law,
    And gibbets keep the lifted hand in awe;
    To murder thousands takes a specious name,
    War's glorious art, and gives immortal fame.
_Love of Fame. Satire vii. Line 55._
    How commentators each dark passage shun,
    And hold their farthing candle to the sun.

    Fear is affront, and jealousy injustice.
_Zara. Epilogue._
    Tender-handed stroke a nettle,
      And it stings you for your pains;
    Grasp it like a man of mettle,
      And it soft as silk remains.

      Use 'em kindly, they rebel;
    But be rough as nutmeg-graters,
      And the rogues obey you well.

SAMUEL MADDEN. 1687-1765.
    Some write their wrongs in marble: he more just,
    Stoop'd down serene and wrote them in the dust,
    Trod under foot, the sport of every wind,
    Swept from the earth and blotted from his mind.
    There, secret in the grave, he bade them lie,
    And grieved they could not 'scape the Almighty eye.

    Awake, my St. John! leave all meaner things
    To low ambition and the pride of kings.

    Expatiate free o'er all this scene of man;
    A mighty maze! but not without a plan.

    Together let us beat this ample field,
    Try what the open, what the covert yield.
_Essay on Man. Epistle i. Line 9._

    Atoms or systems into ruin hurl'd,
    And now a bubble burst, and now a world.
_Essay on Man. Epistle i. Line 87._
    Hope springs eternal in the human breast:
    Man never is, but always to be blest.
    The soul, uneasy and confined from home,
    Rests and expatiates in a life to come.
_Essay on Man. Epistle i. Line 95._
    Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutor'd mind
    Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind;
    His soul proud Science never taught to stray
    Far as the solar walk or milky way.
_Essay on Man. Epistle i. Line 99._
    But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,
    His faithful dog shall bear him company.
_Essay on Man. Epistle i. Line 111._
    In pride, in reasoning pride, our error lies;
    All quit their sphere, and rush into the skies.
    Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes:
    Men would be angels, angels would be gods.

    When Britain first, at Heaven's command,
      Arose from out the azure main,

     Ye who listen with credulity to the whispers of fancy, and

     will perform the promises of youth, and that the deficiencies of
     the present day will be supplied by the morrow,--attend to the
     history of Rasselas, Prince Of Abyssinia.
_Rasselas. Chap. i._
     "I fly from pleasure," said the prince, "because pleasure has

_Boulter's Monument._ 
     Whoever wishes to attain an English style, familiar but not
     coarse, and elegant but not ostentatious, must give his days and
     nights to the volumes of Addison.
_Life of Addison._
     To be of no church is dangerous. Religion, of which the rewards
     are distant, and which is animated only by faith and hope, will
     glide by degrees out of the mind unless it be invigorated and
     reimpressed by external ordinances, by stated calls to worship,
     and the salutary influence of example.

     Sir, he [Bolingbroke] was a scoundrel and a coward: a scoundrel
     for charging a blunderbuss against religion and morality; a
     coward, because he had not resolution to fire it off himself, but
     left half a crown to a beggarly Scotchman to draw the trigger at
     his death.

     A very unclubable man.
_Life of Johnson_ (Boswell). _Vol. ii. Chap. ix. 1764._
     I do not know, sir, that the fellow is an infidel; but if he be

     generally what was new was false."

_Elegy in a Country Churchyard. Stanza 28._
    Here rests his head upon the lap of earth,
      A youth to fortune and to fame unknown:
    Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,
      And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.
_The Epitaph._
    Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
      Heaven did a recompense as largely send:
    He gave to mis'ry (all he had) a tear,
      He gained from Heav'n ('t was all he wish'd) a friend.
_The Epitaph._
    No further seek his merits to disclose,
      Or draw his frailties from their dread abode
    (There they alike in trembling hope repose),
      The bosom of his Father and his God.
_The Epitaph._

_Ode on the Pleasure arising from Vicissitude. Line 53._
    And hie him home, at evening's close,
    To sweet repast and calm repose.
_Ode on the Pleasure arising from Vicissitude. Line 87._
    From toil he wins his spirits light,
    From busy day the peaceful night;
    Rich, from the very want of wealth,
    In heaven's best treasures, peace and health.
_Ode on the Pleasure arising from Vicissitude. Line 93._
    The social smile, the sympathetic tear.
_Education and Government._
    When love could teach a monarch to be wise,
    And gospel-light first dawn'd from Bullen's eyes.
    Too poor for a bribe, and too proud to importune;
    He had not the method of making a fortune.
_On his own Character._
     Now as the Paradisiacal pleasures of the Mahometans consist in

    By all their country's wishes bless'd!
_Ode written in the year 1746._
    By fairy hands their knell is rung;

    To dwell a weeping hermit there!

    The canvas glow'd beyond ev'n Nature warm,
    The pregnant quarry teem'd with human form.

_The Traveller. Line 172._
    Cheerful at morn, he wakes from short repose,

_The Traveller. Line 185._
    So the loud torrent and the whirlwind's roar
    But bind him to his native mountains more.
_The Traveller. Line 217._
    Alike all ages. Dames of ancient days
    Have led their children through the mirthful maze,
    And the gay grandsire, skill'd in gestic lore,
    Has frisk'd beneath the burden of threescore.
_The Traveller. Line 251._
    They please, are pleas'd; they give to get esteem,
    Till seeming blest, they grow to what they seem.

    For talking age and whispering lovers made.
_The Deserted Village. Line 13._
    The bashful virgin's sidelong looks of love.
_The Deserted Village. Line 29._
    Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,
    Where wealth accumulates, and men decay.
    Princes and lords may flourish or may fade,
    A breath can make them, as a breath has made;
    But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,
    When once destroy'd, can never be supplied.
_The Deserted Village. Line 51._
    His best companions, innocence and health;
    And his best riches, ignorance of wealth.
_The Deserted Village. Line 61._
    How blest is he who crowns in shades like these
    A youth of labour with an age of ease!
_The Deserted Village. Line 99._
    While Resignation gently slopes away,
    And all his prospects brightening to the last,
    His heaven commences ere the world be past.
_The Deserted Village. Line 110._
    The watch-dog's voice that bay'd the whispering wind,
    And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind.
_The Deserted Village. Line 121._
    A man he was to all the country dear,
    And passing rich with forty pounds a year.
_The Deserted Village. Line 141._
    Wept o'er his wounds, or tales of sorrow done,
    Shoulder'd his crutch, and shew'd how fields were won.
_The Deserted Village. Line 157._
    Careless their merits or their faults to scan,
    His pity gave ere charity began.
    Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,
    And even his failings lean'd to Virtue's side.
_The Deserted Village. Line 161._
    And as a bird each fond endearment tries
    To tempt its new-fledg'd offspring to the skies,
    He tried each art, reprov'd each dull delay,
    Allur'd to brighter worlds, and led the way.
_The Deserted Village. Line 167._
    Truth from his lips prevail'd with double sway,
    And fools who came to scoff, remain'd to pray.
_The Deserted Village. Line 179._
    Even children follow'd with endearing wile,
    And pluck'd his gown, to share the good man's smile.
_The Deserted Village. Line 183._
    As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form,
    Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,
    Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,
    Eternal sunshine settles on its head.
_The Deserted Village. Line 189._
    Well had the boding tremblers learn'd to trace
    The day's disasters in his morning face;
    Full well they laugh'd with counterfeited glee
    At all his jokes, for many a joke had he;
    Full well the busy whisper circling round
    Convey'd the dismal tidings when he frown'd.
    Yet was he kind, or if severe in aught,
    The love he bore to learning was in fault;
    The village all declar'd how much he knew,
    'T was certain he could write and cipher too.
_The Deserted Village. Line 199._
    In arguing too, the parson own'd his skill,
    For e'en though vanquish'd he could argue still;
    While words of learned length and thundering sound
    Amaz'd the gazing rustics rang'd around;
    And still they gaz'd, and still the wonder grew
    That one small head could carry all he knew.
_The Deserted Village. Line 209._
    Where village statesmen talk'd with looks profound,
    And news much older than their ale went round.
_The Deserted Village. Line 223._
    The whitewash'd wall, the nicely sanded floor,
    The varnish'd clock that click'd behind the door;
    The chest, contriv'd a double debt to pay,
    A bed by night, a chest of drawers by day.
_The Deserted Village. Line 227._
    The twelve good rules, the royal game of goose.
_The Deserted Village. Line 232._
    To me more dear, congenial to my heart,
    One native charm, than all the gloss of art.
_The Deserted Village. Line 253._
    And e'en while fashion's brightest arts decoy,
    The heart distrusting asks if this be joy.
_The Deserted Village. Line 263._
    Her modest looks the cottage might adorn,
    Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn.
_The Deserted Village. Line 329._
    Through torrid tracts with fainting steps they go,
    Where wild Altama murmurs to their woe.
_The Deserted Village. Line 344._
    In all the silent manliness of grief.
_The Deserted Village. Line 384._
    O Luxury! thou curst by Heaven's decree!
_The Deserted Village. Line 385._
    Thou source of all my bliss and all my woe,
    That found'st me poor at first, and keep'st me so.
_The Deserted Village. Line 413._
    Such dainties to them, their health it might hurt;
    It 's like sending them ruffles when wanting a shirt.
_The Haunch of Venison._
    As aromatic plants bestow
    No spicy fragrance while they grow;
    But crush'd or trodden to the ground,
    Diffuse their balmy sweets around.
_The Captivity. Act i._
    To the last moment of his breath,
      On hope the wretch relies;
    And even the pang preceding death
      Bids expectation rise.
_The Captivity. Act ii._
    Hope, like the gleaming taper's light,
      Adorns and cheers our way;
    And still, as darker grows the night,
      Emits a brighter ray.
_The Captivity. Act ii._
    Our Garrick 's a salad; for in him we see
    Oil, vinegar, sugar, and saltness agree!
_Retaliation. Line 11._
    Who mix'd reason with pleasure, and wisdom with mirth:
    If he had any faults, he has left us in doubt.
_Retaliation. Line 24._
    Who, born for the universe, narrow'd his mind,
    And to party gave up what was meant for mankind;
    Though fraught with all learning, yet straining his throat
    To persuade Tommy Townshend to lend him a vote.
    Who too deep for his hearers still went on refining,
    And thought of convincing while they thought of dining:
    Though equal to all things, for all things unfit;
    Too nice for a statesman, too proud for a wit.
_Retaliation. Line 31._
    His conduct still right, with his argument wrong.
_Retaliation. Line 46._
    A flattering painter, who made it his care
    To draw men as they ought to be, not as they are.
_Retaliation. Line 63._
    Here lies David Garrick, describe me who can,
    An abridgment of all that was pleasant in man.
_Retaliation. Line 93._
    As a wit, if not first, in the very first line.
_Retaliation. Line 96._
    On the stage he was natural, simple, affecting;
    'T was only that when he was off he was acting.
_Retaliation. Line 101._
    He cast off his friends as a huntsman his pack,
    For he knew when he pleas'd he could whistle them back.
_Retaliation. Line 107._
    Who pepper'd the highest was surest to please.
_Retaliation. Line 112._
    When they talk'd of their Raphaels, Correggios, and stuff,
    He shifted his trumpet and only took snuff.
_Retaliation. Line 145._
    The best-humour'd man, with the worst-humour'd Muse.
_Postscript._
    Good people all, with one accord,
      Lament for Madam Blaize,
    Who never wanted a good word
      From those who spoke her praise.
_Elegy on Mrs. Mary Blaize._
    The king himself has followed her
      When she has walk'd before.
_Elegy on Mrs. Mary Blaize._
    A kind and gentle heart he had,
      To comfort friends and foes;
    The naked every day he clad
      When he put on his clothes.
_Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog._
    And in that town a dog was found,
      As many dogs there be,
    Both mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound,
      And curs of low degree.
_Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog._
    The dog, to gain his private ends,
      Went mad, and bit the man.
_Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog._
    The man recovered of the bite,
      The dog it was that died.
_Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog._
    A night-cap deck'd his brows instead of bay,
    A cap by night, a stocking all the day.
_Description of an Author's Bed-chamber._
     This same philosophy is a good horse in the stable, but an arrant

     I love everything that 's old: old friends, old times, old
     manners, old books, old wine.
_She Stoops to Conquer. Act i._
     The very pink of perfection.
_She Stoops to Conquer. Act i._
     The genteel thing is the genteel thing any time, if as be that a
     gentleman bees in a concatenation accordingly.
_She Stoops to Conquer. Act i._
     I 'll be with you in the squeezing of a lemon.
_She Stoops to Conquer. Act i._
     Ask me no questions, and I 'll tell you no fibs.
_She Stoops to Conquer. Act iii._
     We sometimes had those little rubs which Providence sends to
     enhance the value of its favours.
_Vicar of Wakefield. Chap. i._
     Handsome is that handsome does.
_Vicar of Wakefield. Chap. i._
     The premises being thus settled, I proceed to observe that the
     concatenation of self-existence, proceeding in a reciprocal
     duplicate ratio, naturally produces a problematical dialogism,
     which in some measure proves that the essence of spirituality may
     be referred to the second predicable.
_Vicar of Wakefield. Chap. vii._
     I find you want me to furnish you with argument and intellect
     too.
_Vicar of Wakefield. Chap. vii._
    Turn, gentle Hermit of the Dale,

_The Hermit. Chap. viii. Stanza 1._
    Taught by that Power that pities me,
      I learn to pity them.
_The Hermit. Chap. viii. Stanza 6._
    Man wants but little here below,
      Nor wants that little long.
_The Hermit. Chap. viii. Stanza 8._
    And what is friendship but a name,
      A charm that lulls to sleep,
    A shade that follows wealth or fame,
      And leaves the wretch to weep?
_The Hermit. Chap. viii. Stanza 19._
    The sigh that rends thy constant heart
      Shall break thy Edwin's too.
_The Hermit. Chap. viii. Stanza 33._
     By the living jingo, she was all of a muck of sweat.
_The Hermit. Chap. ix._
     They would talk of nothing but high life, and high-lived company,
     with other fashionable topics, such as pictures, taste,
     Shakespeare, and the musical glasses.
_The Hermit. Chap. ix._
     It has been a thousand times observed, and I must observe it once
     more, that the hours we pass with happy prospects in view are
     more pleasing than those crowned with fruition.
_The Hermit. Chap. x._
     To what happy accident[402-4] is it that we owe so unexpected a
     visit?
_The Hermit. Chap. xix._
    When lovely woman stoops to folly,
      And finds too late that men betray,
    What charm can soothe her melancholy?
      What art can wash her guilt away?
_The Hermit. On Woman. Chap. xxiv._
    The only art her guilt to cover,
      To hide her shame from every eye,
    To give repentance to her lover,
      And wring his bosom, is--to die.
_The Hermit. On Woman. Chap. xxiv._
     To what fortuitous occurrence do we not owe every pleasure and
     convenience of our lives.
_The Hermit. On Woman. Chap. xxi._
    For he who fights and runs away
    May live to fight another day;
    But he who is in battle slain
    Can never rise and fight again.
_The Art of Poetry on a New Plan_ (1761). _Vol. ii. p. 147._
     One writer, for instance, excels at a plan or a title-page,
     another works away the body of the book, and a third is a dab at
     an index.
_The Bee. No. 1, Oct. 6, 1759._
     The true use of speech is not so much to express our wants as to
     conceal them.

_Guy of Gisborne._
    Have you not heard these many years ago
      Jeptha was judge of Israel?
    He had one only daughter and no mo,
      The which he loved passing well;
            And as by lott,
            God wot,
            It so came to pass,
            As God's will was.
_Jepthah, Judge of Israel._
    A Robyn,
      Jolly Robyn,
    Tell me how thy leman does.
_A Robyn, Jolly Robyn._

    And dolefulle dumps the mynde oppresse,
    There music with her silver sound
    With spede is wont to send redresse.
_A Song to the Lute in Musicke._
    The blinded boy that shootes so trim,
    From heaven downe did hie.
_King Cophetua and the Beggar-maid._
    "What is thy name, faire maid?" quoth he.
    "Penelophon, O King!" quoth she.
_King Cophetua and the Beggar-maid._
    And how should I know your true love
      From many another one?
    Oh, by his cockle hat and staff,
      And by his sandal shoone.
_The Friar of Orders Gray._
    O Lady, he is dead and gone!
      Lady, he 's dead and gone!
    And at his head a green grass turfe,
      And at his heels a stone.
_The Friar of Orders Gray._
    Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more!
      Men were deceivers ever;
    One foot in sea and one on shore,
      To one thing constant never.
_The Friar of Orders Gray._
    Weep no more, lady, weep no more,
      Thy sorrowe is in vaine;
    For violets pluckt, the sweetest showers
      Will ne'er make grow againe.
_The Friar of Orders Gray._
    He that would not when he might,
      He shall not when he wolda.

      Shall think to rob us of our joys,
    You 'll in your girls again be courted,
      And I 'll go wooing in my boys.
_Winifreda_ (1720).
    King Stephen was a worthy peere,
      His breeches cost him but a croune;
    He held them sixpence all too deere,
      Therefore he call'd the taylor loune.
    He was a wight of high renowne,
      And those but of a low degree;
    Itt 's pride that putts the countrye doune,
      Then take thine old cloake about thee.
_Take thy old Cloak about Thee._
    A poore soule sat sighing under a sycamore tree;
      Oh willow, willow, willow!
    With his hand on his bosom, his head on his knee,
      Oh willow, willow, willow!
_Willow, willow, willow._

      To depart her presence soe;
    Having a thousand tongues to allure him,
      And but one to bid him goe.

     The writers against religion, whilst they oppose every system,
     are wisely careful never to set up any of their own.
_A Vindication of Natural Society._[407-1] _Preface, vol. i. p. 7._
     "War," says Machiavel, "ought to be the only study of a prince;"
     and by a prince he means every sort of state, however
     constituted. "He ought," says this great political doctor, "to
     consider peace only as a breathing-time, which gives him leisure
     to contrive, and furnishes ability to execute military plans." A
     meditation on the conduct of political societies made old Hobbes
     imagine that war was the state of nature.
_A Vindication of Natural Society. Vol. i. p. 15._
     I am convinced that we have a degree of delight, and that no

     In such a strait the wisest may well be perplexed and the boldest
     staggered.
_Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents. Vol. i. p. 516._
     When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will
     fall one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible
     struggle.
_Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents. Vol. i. p. 526._
     Of this stamp is the cant of, Not men, but measures.
_Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents. Vol. i. p. 531._

_Speech on the Conciliation of America. Vol. ii. p. 108._
     There is America, which at this day serves for little more than
     to amuse you with stories of savage men and uncouth manners, yet
     shall, before you taste of death, show itself equal to the whole
     of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world.

     A people who are still, as it were, but in the gristle, and not
     yet hardened into the bone of manhood.
_Speech on the Conciliation of America. Vol. ii. p. 117._
     A wise and salutary neglect.
_Speech on the Conciliation of America. Vol. ii. p. 117._
     My vigour relents,--I pardon something to the spirit of liberty.
_Speech on the Conciliation of America. Vol. ii. p. 118._
     The religion most prevalent in our northern colonies is a
     refinement on the principles of resistance: it is the dissidence
     of dissent, and the protestantism of the Protestant religion.
_Speech on the Conciliation of America. Vol. ii. p. 123._
     I do not know the method of drawing up an indictment against a
     whole people.
_Speech on the Conciliation of America. Vol. ii. p. 136._
     The march of the human mind is slow.
_Speech on the Conciliation of America. Vol. ii. p. 149._
     All government,--indeed, every human benefit and enjoyment, every
     virtue and every prudent act,--is founded on compromise and
     barter.
_Speech on the Conciliation of America. Vol. ii. p. 169._
     The worthy gentleman who has been snatched from us at the moment
     of the election, and in the middle of the contest, whilst his
     desires were as warm and his hopes as eager as ours, has
     feelingly told us what shadows we are, and what shadows we
     pursue.

_Reflections on the Revolution in France. Vol. iii. p. 274._
     You had that action and counteraction which, in the natural and
     in the political world, from the reciprocal struggle of
     discordant powers draws out the harmony of the universe.
_Reflections on the Revolution in France. Vol. iii. p. 277._
     It is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the Queen of
     France, then the Dauphiness, at Versailles; and surely never
     lighted on this orb, which she hardly seemed to touch, a more
     delightful vision. I saw her just above the horizon, decorating
     and cheering the elevated sphere she just began to move
     in,--glittering like the morning star full of life and splendour
     and joy. . . . Little did I dream that I should have lived to see
     such disasters fallen upon her in a nation of gallant men,--in a
     nation of men of honour and of cavaliers. I thought ten thousand
     swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a
     look that threatened her with insult. But the age of chivalry is
     gone; that of sophisters, economists, and calculators has
     succeeded.

     Learning will be cast into the mire and trodden down under the
     hoofs of a swinish multitude.
_Reflections on the Revolution in France. Vol. iii. p. 335._
     Because half-a-dozen grasshoppers under a fern make the field
     ring with their importunate chink, whilst thousands of great
     cattle, reposed beneath the shadow of the British oak, chew the
     cud and are silent, pray do not imagine that those who make the
     noise are the only inhabitants of the field; that of course they
     are many in number; or that, after all, they are other than the
     little shrivelled, meagre, hopping, though loud and troublesome
     insects of the hour.
_Reflections on the Revolution in France. Vol. iii. p. 344._
     In their nomination to office they will not appoint to the

     skill. Our antagonist is our helper.

     propensities.
_Letter i. On a Regicide Peace. Vol. v. p. 286._
     All those instances to be found in history, whether real or
     fabulous, of a doubtful public spirit, at which morality is
     perplexed, reason is staggered, and from which affrighted Nature
     recoils, are their chosen and almost sole examples for the
     instruction of their youth.
_Letter i. On a Regicide Peace. Vol. v. p. 311._

    Those who would make us feel--must feel themselves.
_The Rosciad. Line 961._

    The substitute for genius, sense, and wit.
_Table Talk. Line 542._
    Ages elapsed ere Homer's lamp appear'd,

    That good diffused may more abundant grow.
_Conversation. Line 443._
    A business with an income at its heels
    Furnishes always oil for its own wheels.
_Retirement. Line 614._
    Absence of occupation is not rest,
    A mind quite vacant is a mind distress'd.
_Retirement. Line 623._
    An idler is a watch that wants both hands,
    As useless if it goes as if it stands.
_Retirement. Line 681._
    Built God a church, and laugh'd his word to scorn.
_Retirement. Line 688._
                 Philologists, who chase
    A panting syllable through time and space,
    Start it at home, and hunt it in the dark
    To Gaul, to Greece, and into Noah's ark.

_The Task. Book v. The Winter Morning Walk. Line 733._
                  With filial confidence inspired,
    Can lift to Heaven an unpresumptuous eye,
    And smiling say, My Father made them all!
_The Task. Book v. The Winter Morning Walk. Line 745._
    Give what thou canst, without Thee we are poor;
    And with Thee rich, take what Thou wilt away.
_The Task. Book v. The Winter Morning Walk. Line 905._
    There is in souls a sympathy with sounds;
    And as the mind is pitch'd the ear is pleased.
    With melting airs or martial, brisk or grave;
    Some chord in unison with what we hear
    Is touch'd within us, and the heart replies.
    How soft the music of those village bells
    Falling at intervals upon the ear
    In cadence sweet!
_The Task. Book vi. Winter Walk at Noon. Line 1._
                        Here the heart
    May give a useful lesson to the head,
    And Learning wiser grow without his books.
_The Task. Book vi. Winter Walk at Noon. Line 85._
    Knowledge is proud that he has learn'd so much;
    Wisdom is humble that he knows no more.
    Books are not seldom talismans and spells.
_The Task. Book vi. Winter Walk at Noon. Line 96._
    Some to the fascination of a name
    Surrender judgment hoodwink'd.
_The Task. Book vi. Winter Walk at Noon. Line 101._
    I would not enter on my list of friends
    (Though graced with polish'd manners and fine sense,
    Yet wanting sensibility) the man
    Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm.
_The Task. Book vi. Winter Walk at Noon. Line 560._
    An honest man, close-button'd to the chin,
    Broadcloth without, and a warm heart within.
_Epistle to Joseph Hill._

    But they have left an aching void

_Walking with God._
    And Satan trembles when he sees
    The weakest saint upon his knees.
_Exhortation to Prayer._
    God moves in a mysterious way
      His wonders to perform;
    He plants his footsteps in the sea
      And rides upon the storm.
_Light shining out of Darkness._
    Behind a frowning providence
      He hides a shining face.
_Light shining out of Darkness._
    Beware of desperate steps! The darkest day,

    With me but roughly since I heard thee last.
_On the Receipt of my Mother's Picture._
    The son of parents pass'd into the skies.
_On the Receipt of my Mother's Picture._
    The man that hails you Tom or Jack,
    And proves, by thumping on your back,
      His sense of your great merit,
    Is such a friend that one had need
    Be very much his friend indeed
      To pardon or to bear it.
_On Friendship._

_On the Loss of the Royal George._
    There is a bird who by his coat,
    And by the hoarseness of his note,
      Might be supposed a crow.
_The Jackdaw._ (Translation from Vincent Bourne.)
    He sees that this great roundabout
    The world, with all its motley rout,
      Church, army, physic, law,
    Its customs and its businesses,
    Is no concern at all of his,
      And says--what says he?--Caw.
_The Jackdaw._ (Translation from Vincent Bourne.)
    For 't is a truth well known to most,
    That whatsoever thing is lost,
    We seek it, ere it come to light,
    In every cranny but the right.
_The Retired Cat._
    He that holds fast the golden mean,

ERASMUS DARWIN. 1731-1802.
    Soon shall thy arm, unconquer'd steam! afar
    Drag the slow barge, or drive the rapid car;
    Or on wide-waving wings expanded bear
    The flying chariot through the field of air.
_The Botanic Garden. Part i. Canto i. Line 289._
    No radiant pearl which crested Fortune wears,
    No gem that twinkling hangs from Beauty's ears,
    Not the bright stars which Night's blue arch adorn,
    Nor rising suns that gild the vernal morn,
    Shine with such lustre as the tear that flows
    Down Virtue's manly cheek for others' woes.

BEILBY PORTEUS. 1731-1808.

_Death. Line 108._
             One murder made a villain,

    The dews of summer nights did fall,
      The moon, sweet regent of the sky,
    Silvered the walls of Cumnor Hall
      And many an oak that grew thereby.
_Cumnor Hall._

    There 's little pleasure in the house

JOHN LANGHORNE. 1735-1779.
    Cold on Canadian hills or Minden's plain,
    Perhaps that parent mourned her soldier slain;
    Bent o'er her babe, her eye dissolved in dew,
    The big drops mingling with the milk he drew
    Gave the sad presage of his future years,
    The child of misery, baptized in tears.

    He worked and sung from morn till night:
      No lark more blithe than he.
_Love in a Village. Act i. Sc. 2._
    And this the burden of his song
      Forever used to be,
    I care for nobody, no, not I,

    Old age comes on apace to ravage all the clime.
_The Minstrel. Book i. Stanza 25._
    Mine be the breezy hill that skirts the down,
    Where a green grassy turf is all I crave,
    With here and there a violet bestrewn,
    Fast by a brook or fountain's murmuring wave;
    And many an evening sun shine sweetly on my grave!
_The Minstrel. Book ii. Stanza 17._
    At the close of the day when the hamlet is still,
    And mortals the sweets of forgetfulness prove,
    When naught but the torrent is heard on the hill,
    And naught but the nightingale's song in the grove.
_The Hermit._
    He thought as a sage, though he felt as a man.
_The Hermit._
    But when shall spring visit the mouldering urn?
    Oh when shall it dawn on the night of the grave?
_The Hermit._
          By the glare of false science betray'd,
    That leads to bewilder, and dazzles to blind.
_The Hermit._
    And beauty immortal awakes from the tomb.

JOHN ADAMS. 1735-1826.
     Yesterday the greatest question was decided which ever was
     debated in America; and a greater perhaps never was, nor will be,
     decided among men. A resolution was passed without one dissenting
     colony, that those United Colonies are, and of right ought to be,
     free and independent States.
_Letter to Mrs. Adams, July 3, 1776._
     The second day of July, 1776, will be the most memorable epocha
     in the history of America. I am apt to believe that it will be
     celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary
     festival. It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance,
     by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be
     solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns,
     bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this
     continent to the other, from this time forward for evermore.
_Letter to Mrs. Adams, July 3, 1776._

     I am not a Virginian, but an American.
_Speech in the Virginia Convention. September, 1774._
     I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the
     lamp of experience. I know no way of judging of the future but by
     the past.
_Speech in the Virginia Convention. March, 1775._
     Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price
     of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what
     course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give
     me death!
_Speech in the Virginia Convention. March, 1775._
EDWARD GIBBON. 1737-1794.
     The reign of Antoninus is marked by the rare advantage of
     furnishing very few materials for history, which is indeed little

     mankind.

_The American Crisis. No. 1._
     The sublime and the ridiculous are often so nearly related, that
     it is difficult to class them separately. One step above the
     sublime makes the ridiculous, and one step above the ridiculous
     makes the sublime again.

    The tree of deepest root is found

_A Summer's Evening Meditation._

_Come here, Fond Youth._
      Life! we 've been long together
    Through pleasant and through cloudy weather;
      'T is hard to part when friends are dear,
      Perhaps 't will cost a sigh, a tear;
      Then steal away, give little warning,
        Choose thine own time;
    Say not "Good night," but in some brighter clime
        Bid me "Good morning."
_Life._
    So fades a summer cloud away;

_Hymns in Prose. xiii._
THOMAS JEFFERSON. 1743-1826.
     The God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time.
_Summary View of the Rights of British America._
     When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one
     people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them
     with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth the
     separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of
     nature's God[434-2] entitle them, a decent respect to the
     opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes
     which impel them to the separation.
_Declaration of Independence._
     We hold these truths to be self-evident,--that all men are
     created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with
     certain unalienable rights;[434-3] that among these are life,
     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
_Declaration of Independence._
     We mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our
     sacred honour.
_Declaration of Independence._
     Error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to
     combat it.
_First Inaugural Address. March 4, 1801._
     Equal and exact justice to all men, of whatever state or
     persuasion, religious or political; peace, commerce, and honest
     friendship with all nations,--entangling alliances with none; the
     support of the State governments in all their rights, as the most
     competent administrations for our domestic concerns, and the
     surest bulwarks against anti-republican tendencies; the
     preservation of the general government in its whole
     constitutional vigour, as the sheet anchor of our peace at home
     and safety abroad; . . . freedom of religion; freedom of the
     press; freedom of person under the protection of the habeas
     corpus; and trial by juries impartially selected,--these
     principles form the bright constellation which has gone before
     us, and guided our steps through an age of revolution and
     reformation.
_First Inaugural Address. March 4, 1801._
     In the full tide of successful experiment.
_First Inaugural Address. March 4, 1801._
     Of the various executive abilities, no one excited more anxious
     concern than that of placing the interests of our fellow-citizens
     in the hands of honest men, with understanding sufficient for
     their stations.[435-1] No duty is at the same time more difficult
     to fulfil. The knowledge of character possessed by a single
     individual is of necessity limited. To seek out the best through
     the whole Union, we must resort to the information which from the
     best of men, acting disinterestedly and with the purest motives,
     is sometimes incorrect.
_Letter to Elias Shipman and others of New Haven, July 12, 1801._
     If a due participation of office is a matter of right, how are
     vacancies to be obtained? Those by death are few; by resignation,
     none.

     Blandishments will not fascinate us, nor will threats of a

    There 's a sweet little cherub that sits up aloft,
    To keep watch for the life of poor Jack.
_Poor Jack._
    Did you ever hear of Captain Wattle?
    He was all for love, and a little for the bottle.
_Captain Wattle and Miss Roe._
    His form was of the manliest beauty,
      His heart was kind and soft;
    Faithful below he did his duty,
      But now he 's gone aloft.
_Tom Bowling._
    For though his body 's under hatches,
      His soul has gone aloft.
_Tom Bowling._
    Spanking Jack was so comely, so pleasant, so jolly,
      Though winds blew great guns, still he 'd whistle and sing;
    Jack loved his friend, and was true to his Molly,
      And if honour gives greatness, was great as a king.

_Letter to A. Bronson. July 30, 1838._
    This hand, to tyrants ever sworn the foe,
    For Freedom only deals the deadly blow;
    Then sheathes in calm repose the vengeful blade,
    For gentle peace in Freedom's hallowed shade.

DAVID EVERETT. 1769-1813.
    You 'd scarce expect one of my age
    To speak in public on the stage;
    And if I chance to fall below

    Don't view me with a critic's eye,
    But pass my imperfections by.

     Truth is its [justice's] handmaid, freedom is its child, peace is

     If you choose to represent the various parts in life by holes
     upon a table, of different shapes,--some circular, some
     triangular, some square, some oblong,--and the persons acting
     these parts by bits of wood of similar shapes, we shall generally
     find that the triangular person has got into the square hole, the
     oblong into the triangular, and a square person has squeezed
     himself into the round hole. The officer and the office, the doer
     and the thing done, seldom fit so exactly that we can say they
     were almost made for each other.
_Sketches of Moral Philosophy._
     The schoolboy whips his taxed top; the beardless youth manages
     his taxed horse with a taxed bridle on a taxed road; and the
     dying Englishman, pouring his medicine, which has paid seven per
     cent, into a spoon that has paid fifteen per cent, flings himself
     back upon his chintz bed which has paid twenty-two per cent, and
     expires in the arms of an apothecary who has paid a license of a
     hundred pounds for the privilege of putting him to death.

     In the midst of this sublime and terrible storm [at Sidmouth],
     Dame Partington, who lived upon the beach, was seen at the door
     of her house with mop and pattens, trundling her mop, squeezing
     out the sea-water, and vigorously pushing away the Atlantic
     Ocean. The Atlantic was roused; Mrs. Partington's spirit was up.
     But I need not tell you that the contest was unequal; the
     Atlantic Ocean beat Mrs. Partington.

_Despatch, 1815._
     It is very true that I have said that I considered Napoleon's
     presence in the field equal to forty thousand men in the balance.
     This is a very loose way of talking; but the idea is a very

     to a reinforcement of forty thousand men.

WILLIAM ROBERT SPENCER. 1770-1834.

    Of all this unintelligible world,
    Is lightened.
_Lines composed a few miles above Tintern Abbey._
                                   The fretful stir
    Unprofitable, and the fever of the world
    Have hung upon the beatings of my heart.
_Lines composed a few miles above Tintern Abbey._
                    The sounding cataract
    Haunted me like a passion; the tall rock,
    The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,
    Their colours and their forms, were then to me
    An appetite,--a feeling and a love,
    That had no need of a remoter charm
    By thoughts supplied, nor any interest
    Unborrowed from the eye.
_Lines composed a few miles above Tintern Abbey._

                           A sense sublime
    Of something far more deeply interfused,
    Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,
    And the round ocean and the living air
    And the blue sky, and in the mind of man,
    A motion and a spirit, that impels
    All thinking things, all objects of all thought,
    And rolls through all things.
_Lines composed a few miles above Tintern Abbey._
    Knowing that Nature never did betray
    The heart that loved her.
_Lines composed a few miles above Tintern Abbey._
    Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all

    A primrose by a river's brim
    A yellow primrose was to him,
    And it was nothing more.

    The soft blue sky did never melt
    Into his heart; he never felt
    The witchery of the soft blue sky!
_Peter Bell. Part i. Stanza 15._
    On a fair prospect some have looked,
    And felt, as I have heard them say,
    As if the moving time had been
    A thing as steadfast as the scene
    On which they gazed themselves away.
_Peter Bell. Part i. Stanza 16._
    As if the man had fixed his face,
    In many a solitary place,
    Against the wind and open sky!

    One of those heavenly days that cannot die.
_Nutting._
    She dwelt among the untrodden ways
      Beside the springs of Dove,
    A maid whom there were none to praise
      And very few to love.
_She dwelt among the untrodden ways._
    A violet by a mossy stone
      Half hidden from the eye;
    Fair as a star, when only one
      Is shining in the sky.
_She dwelt among the untrodden ways._
    She lived unknown, and few could know
      When Lucy ceased to be;
    But she is in her grave, and oh
      The difference to me!
_She dwelt among the untrodden ways._
    The stars of midnight shall be dear
    To her; and she shall lean her ear
      In many a secret place
    Where rivulets dance their wayward round,
    And beauty born of murmuring sound
      Shall pass into her face.
_Three years she grew in Sun and Shower._
    May no rude hand deface it,
    And its forlorn _hic jacet!_
_Ellen Irwin._
    She gave me eyes, she gave me ears;
    And humble cares, and delicate fears;
    A heart, the fountain of sweet tears;
      And love and thought and joy.
_The Sparrow's Nest._
    The child is father of the man.
_My heart leaps up when I behold._
        The cattle are grazing,

_The Cock is crowing._
    Sweet childish days, that were as long
    As twenty days are now.
_To a Butterfly. I 've watched you now a full half-hour._
    Often have I sighed to measure
    By myself a lonely pleasure,
    Sighed to think I read a book,
    Only read, perhaps, by me.
_To the Small Celandine._
    As high as we have mounted in delight,
    In our dejection do we sink as low.
_Resolution and Independence. Stanza 4._
    But how can he expect that others should
    Build for him, sow for him, and at his call
    Love him, who for himself will take no heed at all?
_Resolution and Independence. Stanza 6._
    I thought of Chatterton, the marvellous boy,
    The sleepless soul that perished in his pride;
    Of him who walked in glory and in joy,
    Following his plough, along the mountain-side.
    By our own spirits we are deified;
    We Poets in our youth begin in gladness,
    But thereof come in the end despondency and madness.
_Resolution and Independence. Stanza 7._
    That heareth not the loud winds when they call,
    And moveth all together, if it moves at all.

    Choice word and measured phrase above the reach
    Of ordinary men.
_Resolution and Independence. Stanza 14._
    And mighty poets in their misery dead.
_Resolution and Independence. Stanza 17._
    Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!
    The river glideth at his own sweet will;
    Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;
    And all that mighty heart is lying still!
_Earth has not anything to show more fair._
    The holy time is quiet as a nun
    Breathless with adoration.
_It is a beauteous Evening._
    Men are we, and must grieve when even the shade
    Of that which once was great is passed away.
_On the Extinction of the Venetian Republic._
                        Thou has left behind
    Powers that will work for thee,--air, earth, and skies!
    There 's not a breathing of the common wind
    That will forget thee; thou hast great allies;
    Thy friends are exultations, agonies,
    And love, and man's unconquerable mind.
_To Toussaint L' Ouverture._
    One that would peep and botanize
    Upon his mother's grave.
_A Poet's Epitaph. Stanza 5._
    He murmurs near the running brooks
    A music sweeter than their own.
_A Poet's Epitaph. Stanza 10._
    And you must love him, ere to you
    He will seem worthy of your love.
_A Poet's Epitaph. Stanza 11._
    The harvest of a quiet eye,
    That broods and sleeps on his own heart.
_A Poet's Epitaph. Stanza 13._
    Yet sometimes, when the secret cup
    Of still and serious thought went round,
    It seemed as if he drank it up,
    He felt with spirit so profound.
_Matthew._
    My eyes are dim with childish tears,
    My heart is idly stirred,
    For the same sound is in my ears
    Which in those days I heard.
_The Fountain._
    A happy youth, and their old age
    Is beautiful and free.

    But something ails it now: the spot is cursed."
_Hart-leap Well. Part ii._
    Hunt half a day for a forgotten dream.
_Hart-leap Well. Part ii._
    Never to blend our pleasure or our pride
    With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels.
_Hart-leap Well. Part ii._
    Plain living and high thinking are no more.
    The homely beauty of the good old cause
    Is gone; our peace, our fearful innocence,
    And pure religion breathing household laws.
_O Friend! I know not which way I must look._
    Milton! thou should'st be living at this hour:
    England hath need of thee!
          .      .      .      .      .      .
    Thy soul was like a star, and dwelt apart:
    So didst thou travel on life's common way
    In cheerful godliness.
_London, 1802._
    We must be free or die who speak the tongue
    That Shakespeare spake, the faith and morals hold
    Which Milton held.

_To the Daisy._
    Thou unassuming commonplace
    Of Nature.
_To the same Flower._
    Oft on the dappled turf at ease
    I sit, and play with similes,
    Loose type of things through all degrees.
_To the same Flower._
    Sweet Mercy! to the gates of heaven
    This minstrel lead, his sins forgiven;

      With vain endeavour,
    And memory of Earth's bitter leaven
      Effaced forever.

_The Solitary Reaper._
    Yon foaming flood seems motionless as ice;
    Its dizzy turbulence eludes the eye,
    Frozen by distance.

    The English ballad-singer's joy.
_Rob Roy's Grave._

    Sufficeth them,--the simple plan,
    That they should take who have the power,
           And they should keep who can.
_Rob Roy's Grave._
    The Eagle, he was lord above,
      And Rob was lord below.
_Rob Roy's Grave._
    A brotherhood of venerable trees.
_Sonnet composed at ---- Castle._
    Let beeves and home-bred kine partake
    The sweets of Burn-mill meadow;
    The swan on still St. Mary's Lake
    Float double, swan and shadow!
_Yarrow Unvisited._
               Every gift of noble origin
    Is breathed upon by Hope's perpetual breath.

    A remnant of uneasy light.
_The Matron of Jedborough._
    Oh for a single hour of that Dundee
    Who on that day the word of onset gave!
_Sonnet, in the Pass of Killicranky._
    O Cuckoo! shall I call thee bird,
    Or but a wandering voice?
_To the Cuckoo._
    She was a phantom of delight
    When first she gleamed upon my sight,
    A lovely apparition, sent
    To be a moment's ornament;
    Her eyes as stars of twilight fair,
    Like twilights too her dusky hair,
    But all things else about her drawn
    From May-time and the cheerful dawn.
_She was a Phantom of Delight._
    A creature not too bright or good
    For human nature's daily food;
    For transient sorrows, simple wiles,
    Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles.
_She was a Phantom of Delight._
    The reason firm, the temperate will,
    Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill;
    A perfect woman, nobly planned,
    To warn, to comfort, and command.
_She was a Phantom of Delight._
                      That inward eye
    Which is the bliss of solitude.
_I wandered lonely._
    To be a Prodigal's favourite,--then, worse truth,
    A Miser's pensioner,--behold our lot!
_The Small Celandine._
    Stern Daughter of the Voice of God!
_Ode to Duty._
               A light to guide, a rod
    To check the erring, and reprove.
_Ode to Duty._
    Give unto me, made lowly wise,
    The spirit of self-sacrifice;
    The confidence of reason give,
    And in the light of truth thy bondman let me live!
_Ode to Duty._
    The light that never was, on sea or land;
    The consecration, and the Poet's dream.
_Suggested by a Picture of Peele Castle in a Storm. Stanza 4._
    Shalt show us how divine a thing
    A woman may be made.
_To a Young Lady. Dear Child of Nature._
    But an old age serene and bright,
    And lovely as a Lapland night,
      Shall lead thee to thy grave.
_To a Young Lady. Dear Child of Nature._
                     Where the statue stood
    Of Newton, with his prism and silent face,
    The marble index of a mind forever
    Voyaging through strange seas of thought alone.
_The Prelude. Book iii._
                     Another morn
    Risen on mid-noon.

    Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,
    But to be young was very heaven!
_The Prelude. Book xi._
    The budding rose above the rose full blown.
_The Prelude. Book xi._
                             There is
    One great society alone on earth:
    The noble living and the noble dead.
_The Prelude. Book xi._
    Who, doomed to go in company with Pain
    And Fear and Bloodshed,--miserable train!
    Turns his necessity to glorious gain.
_Character of the Happy Warrior._
    Controls them and subdues, transmutes, bereaves
    Of their bad influence, and their good receives.
_Character of the Happy Warrior._
    But who, if he be called upon to face
    Some awful moment to which Heaven has joined
    Great issues, good or bad for humankind,
    Is happy as a lover.
_Character of the Happy Warrior._
    And through the heat of conflict keeps the law
    In calmness made, and sees what he foresaw.
_Character of the Happy Warrior._
    Whom neither shape of danger can dismay,
    Nor thought of tender happiness betray.
_Character of the Happy Warrior._
    Like,--but oh how different!
_Yes, it was the Mountain Echo._
    The world is too much with us; late and soon,
    Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:
    Little we see in Nature that is ours.
_Miscellaneous Sonnets. Part i. xxxiii._
              Great God! I 'd rather be
    A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn,
    So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,
    Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
    Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea,
    Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.
_Miscellaneous Sonnets. Part i. xxxiii._
    Maidens withering on the stalk.
_Personal Talk. Stanza 1._
                           Sweetest melodies
    Are those that are by distance made more sweet.
_Personal Talk. Stanza 2._
    Dreams, books, are each a world; and books, we know,
    Are a substantial world, both pure and good.
    Round these, with tendrils strong as flesh and blood,
    Our pastime and our happiness will grow.
_Personal Talk. Stanza 3._
    The gentle Lady married to the Moor,
    And heavenly Una with her milk-white lamb.

    Of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays.

    The rainbow comes and goes,
    And lovely is the rose.
_Ode. Intimations of Immortality. Stanza 2._
        The sunshine is a glorious birth;
        But yet I know, where'er I go,
    That there hath passed away a glory from the earth.
_Ode. Intimations of Immortality. Stanza 2._
    Where is it now, the glory and the dream?
_Ode. Intimations of Immortality. Stanza 5._
    Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
    The soul that rises with us, our life's star,
        Hath had elsewhere its setting,
          And cometh from afar.
        Not in entire forgetfulness,
        And not in utter nakedness,
    But trailing clouds of glory, do we come
        From God, who is our home:
    Heaven lies about us in our infancy.
_Ode. Intimations of Immortality. Stanza 5._
    At length the man perceives it die away,
    And fade into the light of common day.
_Ode. Intimations of Immortality. Stanza 5._
    The thought of our past years in me doth breed
    Perpetual benediction.
_Ode. Intimations of Immortality. Stanza 9._
              Those obstinate questionings
        Of sense and outward things,
        Fallings from us, vanishings,
        Blank misgivings of a creature
    Moving about in worlds not realized,
    High instincts before which our mortal nature
    Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised.
_Ode. Intimations of Immortality. Stanza 9._
                Truths that wake,
    To perish never.
_Ode. Intimations of Immortality. Stanza 9._
        Though inland far we be,
    Our souls have sight of that immortal sea
        Which brought us hither.
_Ode. Intimations of Immortality. Stanza 9._
    Though nothing can bring back the hour
    Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower.

    In years that bring the philosophic mind.
_Ode. Intimations of Immortality. Stanza 10._
    The clouds that gather round the setting sun
    Do take a sober colouring from an eye
    That hath kept watch o'er man's mortality.
_Ode. Intimations of Immortality. Stanza 11._
    To me the meanest flower that blows can give
    Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.
_Ode. Intimations of Immortality. Stanza 11._
    Two voices are there: one is of the sea,
    One of the mountains,--each a mighty voice.
_Thought of a Briton on the Subjugation of Switzerland._
    Earth helped him with the cry of blood.
_Song at the Feast of Broughton Castle._
    The silence that is in the starry sky.
_Song at the Feast of Broughton Castle._
    The monumental pomp of age
    Was with this goodly personage;
    A stature undepressed in size,
    Unbent, which rather seemed to rise
    In open victory o'er the weight
    Of seventy years, to loftier height.
_The White Doe of Rylstone. Canto iii._
    "What is good for a bootless bene?"
    With these dark words begins my tale;
    And their meaning is, Whence can comfort spring
    When prayer is of no avail?
_Force of Prayer._
    A few strong instincts, and a few plain rules.
_Alas! what boots the long laborious Quest?_
    Of blessed consolations in distress.
_Preface to the Excursion._ (Edition, 1814.)
    The vision and the faculty divine;
    Yet wanting the accomplishment of verse.
_The Excursion. Book i._
    The imperfect offices of prayer and praise.
_The Excursion. Book i._
                 That mighty orb of song,
    The divine Milton.
_The Excursion. Book i._
                         The good die first,
    And they whose hearts are dry as summer dust
    Burn to the socket.
_The Excursion. Book i._
    This dull product of a scoffer's pen.
_The Excursion. Book ii._
    With battlements that on their restless fronts
    Bore stars.
_The Excursion. Book ii._
    Wisdom is ofttimes nearer when we stoop
    Than when we soar.
_The Excursion. Book iii._
    Wrongs unredressed, or insults unavenged.
_The Excursion. Book iii._
           Monastic brotherhood, upon rock
    Aerial.
_The Excursion. Book iii._
    The intellectual power, through words and things,
    Went sounding on a dim and perilous way!
_The Excursion. Book iii._
    Society became my glittering bride,
    And airy hopes my children.
_The Excursion. Book iii._
    And the most difficult of tasks to keep
    Heights which the soul is competent to gain.
_The Excursion. Book iv._
    There is a luxury in self-dispraise;
    And inward self-disparagement affords
    To meditative spleen a grateful feast.
_The Excursion. Book iv._
        Recognizes ever and anon
    The breeze of Nature stirring in his soul.
_The Excursion. Book iv._
                       Pan himself,
    The simple shepherd's awe-inspiring god!
_The Excursion. Book iv._
                       I have seen
    A curious child, who dwelt upon a tract
    Of inland ground, applying to his ear
    The convolutions of a smooth-lipped shell,
    To which, in silence hushed, his very soul
    Listened intensely; and his countenance soon
    Brightened with joy, for from within were heard
    Murmurings, whereby the monitor expressed
    Mysterious union with his native sea.
_The Excursion. Book iv._
    So build we up the being that we are.
_The Excursion. Book iv._
        One in whom persuasion and belief
    Had ripened into faith, and faith become
    A passionate intuition.
_The Excursion. Book iv._
    Spires whose "silent finger points to heaven."
_The Excursion. Book vi._
    Ah, what a warning for a thoughtless man,
    Could field or grove, could any spot of earth,
    Show to his eye an image of the pangs
    Which it hath witnessed,--render back an echo
    Of the sad steps by which it hath been trod!
_The Excursion. Book vi._
                   And when the stream
    Which overflowed the soul was passed away,
    A consciousness remained that it had left
    Deposited upon the silent shore
    Of memory images and precious thoughts
    That shall not die, and cannot be destroyed.
_The Excursion. Book vii._
    Wisdom married to immortal verse.
_The Excursion. Book vii._
    A man he seems of cheerful yesterdays
    And confident to-morrows.
_The Excursion. Book vii._
    The primal duties shine aloft, like stars;
    The charities that soothe and heal and bless
    Are scattered at the feet of man like flowers.
_The Excursion. Book ix._
                By happy chance we saw
    A twofold image: on a grassy bank
    A snow-white ram, and in the crystal flood
    Another and the same!
_The Excursion. Book ix._
                           The gods approve
    The depth, and not the tumult, of the soul.
_Laodamia._
                                    Mightier far
    Than strength of nerve or sinew, or the sway
    Of magic potent over sun and star,
    Is Love, though oft to agony distrest,
    And though his favorite seat be feeble woman's breast.
_Laodamia._
    Elysian beauty, melancholy grace,
    Brought from a pensive though a happy place.
_Laodamia._
    He spake of love, such love as spirits feel
    In worlds whose course is equable and pure;
    No fears to beat away, no strife to heal,
    The past unsighed for, and the future sure.
_Laodamia._
    Of all that is most beauteous, imaged there
    In happier beauty; more pellucid streams,
    An ampler ether, a diviner air,
    And fields invested with purpureal gleams.
_Laodamia._
    Yet tears to human suffering are due;
    And mortal hopes defeated and o'erthrown
    Are mourned by man, and not by man alone.
_Laodamia._
    But shapes that come not at an earthly call
    Will not depart when mortal voices bid.
_Dion._
    But thou that didst appear so fair
      To fond imagination,
    Dost rival in the light of day
      Her delicate creation.
_Yarrow Visited._
    'T is hers to pluck the amaranthine flower
    Of faith, and round the sufferer's temples bind
    Wreaths that endure affliction's heaviest shower,
    And do not shrink from sorrow's keenest wind.
_Weak is the Will of Man._
    We bow our heads before Thee, and we laud
    And magnify thy name Almighty God!
    But man is thy most awful instrument
    In working out a pure intent.
_Ode. Imagination before Content._
    Sad fancies do we then affect,
    In luxury of disrespect
    To our own prodigal excess
    Of too familiar happiness.
_Ode to Lycoris._
    That kill the bloom before its time,
    And blanch, without the owner's crime,
    The most resplendent hair.
_Lament of Mary Queen of Scots._
    The sightless Milton, with his hair
    Around his placid temples curled;
    And Shakespeare at his side,--a freight,
    If clay could think and mind were weight,
    For him who bore the world!
_The Italian Itinerant._
    Meek Nature's evening comment on the shows
    That for oblivion take their daily birth
    From all the fuming vanities of earth.
_Sky-Prospect from the Plain of France._
    Turning, for them who pass, the common dust
    Of servile opportunity to gold.
_Desultory Stanza._
                            Babylon,
    Learned and wise, hath perished utterly,
    Nor leaves her speech one word to aid the sigh
    That would lament her.
_Ecclesiastical Sonnets. Part i. xxv. Missions and Travels._
    As thou these ashes, little brook, wilt bear
    Into the Avon, Avon to the tide
    Of Severn, Severn to the narrow seas,
    Into main ocean they, this deed accursed
    An emblem yields to friends and enemies
    How the bold teacher's doctrine, sanctified
    By truth, shall spread, throughout the world dispersed.
_Ecclesiastical Sonnets. Part ii. xvii. To Wickliffe._
                        The feather, whence the pen
    Was shaped that traced the lives of these good men,
    Dropped from an angel's wing.
_Ecclesiastical Sonnets. Part iii. v. Walton's Book of Lives._
    Meek Walton's heavenly memory.
_Ecclesiastical Sonnets. Part iii. v. Walton's Book of Lives._
    But who would force the soul tilts with a straw
    Against a champion cased in adamant.
_Ecclesiastical Sonnets. Part iii. vii. Persecution of the Scottish
Covenanters._
                       Where music dwells
    Lingering and wandering on as loth to die,
    Like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof
    That they were born for immortality.
_Ecclesiastical Sonnets. Part iii. xliii. Inside of King's Chapel,
Cambridge._
    Or shipwrecked, kindles on the coast
    False fires, that others may be lost.
_To the Lady Fleming._
    But hushed be every thought that springs
    From out the bitterness of things.
_Elegiac Stanzas. Addressed to Sir G. H. B._
                          To the solid ground
    Of Nature trusts the mind that builds for aye.
_A Volant Tribe of Bards on Earth._
    Soft is the music that would charm forever;
    The flower of sweetest smell is shy and lowly.
_Not Love, not War._
    True beauty dwells in deep retreats,
      Whose veil is unremoved
    Till heart with heart in concord beats,
      And the lover is beloved.
_To ----. Let other Bards of Angels sing._
    Type of the wise who soar but never roam,
    True to the kindred points of heaven and home.
_To a Skylark._
    A Briton even in love should be
    A subject, not a slave!
_Ere with Cold Beads of Midnight Dew._
    Scorn not the sonnet. Critic, you have frowned,
    Mindless of its just honours; with this key
    Shakespeare unlocked his heart.
_Scorn not the Sonnet._
                    And when a damp
    Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand
    The thing became a trumpet; whence he blew
    Soul-animating strains,--alas! too few.
_Scorn not the Sonnet._
    But he is risen, a later star of dawn.
_A Morning Exercise._
    Bright gem instinct with music, vocal spark.
_A Morning Exercise._
              When his veering gait
    And every motion of his starry train
    Seem governed by a strain
    Of music, audible to him alone.
_The Triad._
    Alas! how little can a moment show
    Of an eye where feeling plays
    In ten thousand dewy rays:
    A face o'er which a thousand shadows go!
_The Triad._
    Stern Winter loves a dirge-like sound.
_On the Power of Sound. xii._
    The bosom-weight, your stubborn gift,
    That no philosophy can lift.
_Presentiments._
    Nature's old felicities.
_The Trosachs._
    Myriads of daisies have shone forth in flower
    Near the lark's nest, and in their natural hour
    Have passed away; less happy than the one
    That by the unwilling ploughshare died to prove
    The tender charm of poetry and love.
_Poems composed during a Tour in the Summer of 1833. xxxvii._
    Small service is true service while it lasts.
    Of humblest friends, bright creature! scorn not one:
    The daisy, by the shadow that it casts,
    Protects the lingering dewdrop from the sun.
_To a Child. Written in her Album._
    Since every mortal power of Coleridge
    Was frozen at its marvellous source,
    The rapt one, of the godlike forehead,
    The heaven-eyed creature sleeps in earth:
    And Lamb, the frolic and the gentle,
    Has vanished from his lonely hearth.
_Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg._
    How fast has brother followed brother,
    From sunshine to the sunless land!
_Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg._
    Those old credulities, to Nature dear,
    Shall they no longer bloom upon the stock
    Of history?
_Memorials of a Tour in Italy. iv._
    How does the meadow-flower its bloom unfold?
    Because the lovely little flower is free
    Down to its root, and in that freedom bold.
_A Poet! He hath put his Heart to School._
    Minds that have nothing to confer
      Find little to perceive.
_Yes, Thou art Fair._
SIR WALTER SCOTT. 1771-1832.
    Such is the custom of Branksome Hall.
_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto i. Stanza 7._
    If thou would'st view fair Melrose aright,
    Go visit it by the pale moonlight.
_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto ii. Stanza 1._
    O fading honours of the dead!
    O high ambition, lowly laid!
_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto ii. Stanza 10._
    I was not always a man of woe.
_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto ii. Stanza 12._
    I cannot tell how the truth may be;
    I say the tale as 't was said to me.
_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto ii. Stanza 22._
    In peace, Love tunes the shepherd's reed;
    In war, he mounts the warrior's steed;
    In halls, in gay attire is seen;
    In hamlets, dances on the green.
    Love rules the court, the camp, the grove,
    And men below and saints above;
    For love is heaven, and heaven is love.
_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto iii. Stanza 1._
    Her blue eyes sought the west afar,
    For lovers love the western star.
_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto iii. Stanza 24._
    Along thy wild and willow'd shore.
_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto iv. Stanza 1._
                            Ne'er
    Was flattery lost on poet's ear;
    A simple race! they waste their toil
    For the vain tribute of a smile.
_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto iv. Stanza 35._
    Call it not vain: they do not err
    Who say that when the poet dies
    Mute Nature mourns her worshipper,
    And celebrates his obsequies.
_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto v. Stanza 1._
    True love 's the gift which God has given
    To man alone beneath the heaven:
      It is not fantasy's hot fire,
        Whose wishes soon as granted fly;
      It liveth not in fierce desire,
        With dead desire it doth not die;
    It is the secret sympathy,
    The silver link, the silken tie,
    Which heart to heart and mind to mind
    In body and in soul can bind.
_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto v. Stanza 13._
    Breathes there the man with soul so dead
    Who never to himself hath said,
      This is my own, my native land!
    Whose heart hath ne'er within him burn'd
    As home his footsteps he hath turn'd
      From wandering on a foreign strand?
    If such there breathe, go, mark him well!
    For him no minstrel raptures swell;
    High though his titles, proud his name,
    Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,
    Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
    The wretch, concentred all in self,
    Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
    And, doubly dying, shall go down
    To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
    Unwept, unhonour'd, and unsung.
_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto vi. Stanza 1._
    O Caledonia! stern and wild,
    Meet nurse for a poetic child!
    Land of brown heath and shaggy wood;
    Land of the mountain and the flood!
_Lay of the Last Minstrel. Canto vi. Stanza 2._
    Profan'd the God-given strength, and marr'd the lofty line.
_Marmion. Introduction to Canto i._
    Just at the age 'twixt boy and youth,
    When thought is speech, and speech is truth.
_Marmion. Introduction to Canto ii._
    When, musing on companions gone,
    We doubly feel ourselves alone.
_Marmion. Introduction to Canto ii._
    'T is an old tale and often told;
      But did my fate and wish agree,
    Ne'er had been read, in story old,
    Of maiden true betray'd for gold,
      That loved, or was avenged, like me.
_Marmion. Canto ii. Stanza 27._
    When Prussia hurried to the field,
    And snatch'd the spear, but left the shield.
_Marmion. Introduction to Canto iii._
    In the lost battle,
      Borne down by the flying,
    Where mingles war's rattle
      With groans of the dying.
_Marmion. Canto iii. Stanza 11._
    Where 's the coward that would not dare
      To fight for such a land?
_Marmion. Canto iv. Stanza 30._
    Lightly from fair to fair he flew,
    And loved to plead, lament, and sue;
    Suit lightly won, and short-lived pain,
    For monarchs seldom sigh in vain.
_Marmion. Canto v. Stanza 9._
    With a smile on her lips and a tear in her eye.
_Marmion. Canto v. Stanza 12._
    But woe awaits a country when
    She sees the tears of bearded men.
_Marmion. Canto v. Stanza 16._
               And dar'st thou then
    To beard the lion in his den,
      The Douglas in his hall?
_Marmion. Canto vi. Stanza 14._
    Oh what a tangled web we weave,
    When first we practise to deceive!
_Marmion. Canto vi. Stanza 17._
    O woman! in our hours of ease
    Uncertain, coy, and hard to please,
    And variable as the shade
    By the light quivering aspen made;
    When pain and anguish wring the brow,
    A ministering angel thou!
_Marmion. Canto vi. Stanza 30._
    "Charge, Chester, charge! on, Stanley, on!"
    Were the last words of Marmion.

    On Fontarabian echoes borne!

    In listening mood she seemed to stand,
    The guardian Naiad of the strand.

    And ne'er did Grecian chisel trace
    A Nymph, a Naiad, or a Grace
    Of finer form or lovelier face.
_Lady of the Lake. Canto i. Stanza 18._
    A foot more light, a step more true,
    Ne'er from the heath-flower dash'd the dew.
_Lady of the Lake. Canto i. Stanza 18._
    On his bold visage middle age
    Had slightly press'd its signet sage,
    Yet had not quench'd the open truth
    And fiery vehemence of youth:
    Forward and frolic glee was there,
    The will to do, the soul to dare.
_Lady of the Lake. Canto i. Stanza 21._
    Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking,
    Morn of toil nor night of waking.
_Lady of the Lake. Canto i. Stanza 31._
    Hail to the chief who in triumph advances!
_Lady of the Lake. Canto ii. Stanza 19._

    With less of earth in them than heaven.
_Lady of the Lake. Canto ii. Stanza 22._
    Time rolls his ceaseless course.
_Lady of the Lake. Canto iii. Stanza 1._
    Like the dew on the mountain,
      Like the foam on the river,
    Like the bubble on the fountain,
      Thou art gone, and forever!
_Lady of the Lake. Canto iii. Stanza 16._
    The rose is fairest when 't is budding new,
      And hope is brightest when it dawns from fears.
    The rose is sweetest wash'd with morning dew,
      And love is loveliest when embalm'd in tears.
_Lady of the Lake. Canto iv. Stanza 1._
    Art thou a friend to Roderick?
_Lady of the Lake. Canto iv. Stanza 30._
    Come one, come all! this rock shall fly
    From its firm base as soon as I.
_Lady of the Lake. Canto v. Stanza 10._
    And the stern joy which warriors feel
    In foemen worthy of their steel.
_Lady of the Lake. Canto v. Stanza 10._
    Who o'er the herd would wish to reign,
    Fantastic, fickle, fierce, and vain!
    Vain as the leaf upon the stream,
    And fickle as a changeful dream;
    Fantastic as a woman's mood,
    And fierce as Frenzy's fever'd blood.
    Thou many-headed monster[492-1] thing,
    Oh who would wish to be thy king!
_Lady of the Lake. Canto v. Stanza 30._
      Where, where was Roderick then?
    One blast upon his bugle horn
      Were worth a thousand men.
_Lady of the Lake. Canto vi. Stanza 18._
    In man's most dark extremity
    Oft succour dawns from Heaven.
_Lord of the Isles. Canto i. Stanza 20._
    Spangling the wave with lights as vain
    As pleasures in the vale of pain,
      That dazzle as they fade.
_Lord of the Isles. Canto i. Stanza 23._
    Oh, many a shaft at random sent
    Finds mark the archer little meant!
    And many a word at random spoken
    May soothe, or wound, a heart that 's broken!
_Lord of the Isles. Canto v. Stanza 18._
    Where lives the man that has not tried
    How mirth can into folly glide,
      And folly into sin!
_Bridal of Triermain. Canto i. Stanza 21._
    Still are the thoughts to memory dear.
_Rokeby. Canto i. Stanza 32._
    A mother's pride, a father's joy.
_Rokeby. Canto iii. Stanza 15._
    Oh, Brignall banks are wild and fair,
      And Greta woods are green,
    And you may gather garlands there
      Would grace a summer's queen.
_Rokeby. Canto iii. Stanza 16._
    Thus aged men, full loth and slow,
    The vanities of life forego,
    And count their youthful follies o'er,
    Till Memory lends her light no more.
_Rokeby. Canto v. Stanza 1._
    No pale gradations quench his ray,
    No twilight dews his wrath allay.
_Rokeby. Canto vi. Stanza 21._
    Come as the winds come, when
      Forests are rended;
    Come as the waves come, when
      Navies are stranded.
_Pibroch of Donald Dhu._
     A lawyer without history or literature is a mechanic, a mere

    When the good man yields his breath
    (For the good man never dies).

    Gashed with honourable scars,
      Low in Glory's lap they lie;

      Streaming splendour through the sky.

_The World before the Flood. Canto v._
        Joys too exquisite to last,
    And yet _more_ exquisite when past.
_The Little Cloud._
    Bliss in possession will not last;
    Remembered joys are never past;
    At once the fountain, stream, and sea,
    They were, they are, they yet shall be.
_The Little Cloud._
    Friend after friend departs;
      Who hath not lost a friend?
    There is no union here of hearts
      That finds not here an end.
_Friends._
    Nor sink those stars in empty night:
    They hide themselves in heaven's own light.
_Friends._
    'T is not the whole of life to live,
      Nor all of death to die.
_The Issues of Life and Death._
    Beyond this vale of tears
      There is a life above,
    Unmeasured by the flight of years;
      And all that life is love.
_The Issues of Life and Death._
    Night is the time to weep,
      To wet with unseen tears
    Those graves of memory where sleep
      The joys of other years.
_The Issues of Life and Death._
    Who that hath ever been
      Could bear to be no more?
    Yet who would tread again the scene
      He trod through life before?
_The Falling Leaf._
    Here in the body pent,
      Absent from Him I roam,
    Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
      A day's march nearer home.

    If God hath made this world so fair,
      Where sin and death abound,
    How beautiful beyond compare
      Will paradise be found!
_The Earth full of God's Goodness._
    Return unto thy rest, my soul,
      From all the wanderings of thy thought,
    From sickness unto death made whole,
      Safe through a thousand perils brought.
_Rest for the Soul._
    Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,
      Uttered or unexpressed,
    The motion of a hidden fire
      That trembles in the breast.
_What is Prayer?_
    Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
      The falling of a tear,
    The upward glancing of an eye
      When none but God is near.
_What is Prayer?_
SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE. 1772-1834.
    He holds him with his glittering eye,
    And listens like a three years' child.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part i._
    Red as a rose is she.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part i._
    We were the first that ever burst
    Into that silent sea.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part ii._
    As idle as a painted ship
    Upon a painted ocean.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part ii._
    Water, water, everywhere,
    Nor any drop to drink.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part ii._
    Without a breeze, without a tide,
    She steadies with upright keel.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part iii._
    The nightmare Life-in-Death was she.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part iii._
    The sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:
    At one stride comes the dark;
    With far-heard whisper o'er the sea,
    Off shot the spectre-bark.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part iii._
    And thou art long and lank and brown,
    As is the ribbed sea-sand.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part iv._
    Alone, alone,--all, all alone;
    Alone on a wide, wide sea.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part iv._
    The moving moon went up the sky,
    And nowhere did abide;
    Softly she was going up,
    And a star or two beside.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part iv._
    A spring of love gush'd from my heart,
    And I bless'd them unaware.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part iv._
    Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing,
    Beloved from pole to pole.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part v._
    A noise like of a hidden brook
    In the leafy month of June,
    That to the sleeping woods all night
    Singeth a quiet tune.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part v._
    Like one that on a lonesome road
    Doth walk in fear and dread,
    And having once turned round walks on,
    And turns no more his head,
    Because he knows a frightful fiend
    Doth close behind him tread.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part vi._
    So lonely 't was, that God himself
    Scarce seemed there to be.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part vii._
    He prayeth well who loveth well
    Both man and bird and beast.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part vii._
    He prayeth best who loveth best
    All things both great and small.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part vii._
    A sadder and a wiser man,
    He rose the morrow morn.
_The Ancient Mariner. Part vii._
    And the spring comes slowly up this way.
_Christabel. Part i._
    A lady richly clad as she,
    Beautiful exceedingly.
_Christabel. Part i._
    Carv'd with figures strange and sweet,
    All made out of the carver's brain.
_Christabel. Part i._
    Her gentle limbs did she undress,
    And lay down in her loveliness.
_Christabel. Part i._
    A sight to dream of, not to tell!
_Christabel. Part i._
    That saints will aid if men will call;
    For the blue sky bends over all!
_Christabel. Conclusion to part i._
    Each matin bell, the Baron saith,
    Knells us back to a world of death.
_Christabel. Part ii._
    Her face, oh call it fair, not pale!
_Christabel. Part ii._
    Alas! they had been friends in youth;
    But whispering tongues can poison truth,
    And constancy lives in realms above;
    And life is thorny, and youth is vain,
    And to be wroth with one we love
    Doth work like madness in the brain.
_Christabel. Part ii._
    They stood aloof, the scars remaining,
    Like cliffs which had been rent asunder:
    A dreary sea now flows between.
_Christabel. Part ii._
    Perhaps 't is pretty to force together
    Thoughts so all unlike each other;
    To mutter and mock a broken charm,
    To dally with wrong that does no harm.
_Christabel. Conclusion to Part ii._
    In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
    A stately pleasure-dome decree,
    Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
    Through caverns measureless to man
      Down to a sunless sea.
_Kubla Khan._
    Ancestral voices prophesying war.
_Kubla Khan._
    A damsel with a dulcimer
    In a vision once I saw:
    It was an Abyssinian maid,
    And on her dulcimer she played,
    Singing of Mount Abora.
_Kubla Khan._
    For he on honey-dew hath fed,
    And drunk the milk of Paradise.
_Kubla Khan._
    Ere sin could blight or sorrow fade,
      Death came with friendly care;
    The opening bud to heaven conveyed,
      And bade it blossom there.
_Epitaph on an Infant._
    Yes, while I stood and gazed, my temples bare,
    And shot my being through earth, sea, and air,
    Possessing all things with intensest love,
    O Liberty! my spirit felt thee there.
_France. An Ode. v._
    Forth from his dark and lonely hiding-place
    (Portentous sight!) the owlet Atheism,
    Sailing on obscene wings athwart the noon,
    Drops his blue-fring'd lids, and holds them close,
    And hooting at the glorious sun in heaven
    Cries out, "Where is it?"
_Fears in Solitude._
    And the Devil did grin, for his darling sin
      Is pride that apes humility.
_The Devil's Thoughts._
    All thoughts, all passions, all delights,
    Whatever stirs this mortal frame,
      All are but ministers of Love,
        And feed his sacred flame.
_Love._
    Blest hour! it was a luxury--to be!
_Reflections on having left a Place of Retirement._
                                    A charm
    For thee, my gentle-hearted Charles, to whom
    No sound is dissonant which tells of life.
_This Lime-tree Bower my Prison._
    Hast thou a charm to stay the morning star
    In his steep course?

    Motionless torrents! silent cataracts!
_Hymn in the Vale of Chamouni._
    Ye living flowers that skirt the eternal frost.
_Hymn in the Vale of Chamouni._
    Earth with her thousand voices praises God.
_Hymn in the Vale of Chamouni._
    Tranquillity! thou better name
    Than all the family of Fame.
_Ode to Tranquillity._
    The grand old ballad of Sir Patrick Spence.
_Dejection. An Ode. Stanza 1._
    Joy is the sweet voice, joy the luminous cloud.
      We in ourselves rejoice!
    And thence flows all that charms or ear or sight,
      All melodies the echoes of that voice,
    All colours a suffusion from that light.
_Dejection. An Ode. Stanza 5._
    A mother is a mother still,
      The holiest thing alive.

    Never alone.
_The Visit of the Gods._ (Imitated from Schiller.)
    Joy rises in me, like a summer's morn.
_A Christmas Carol. viii._
    The knight's bones are dust,
    And his good sword rust;
    His soul is with the saints, I trust.
_The Knight's Tomb._
    It sounds like stories from the land of spirits
    If any man obtains that which he merits,
    Or any merit that which he obtains.
        .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .
    Greatness and goodness are not means, but ends!
    Hath he not always treasures, always friends,
    The good great man? Three treasures,--love and light,
    And calm thoughts, regular as infants' breath;
    And three firm friends, more sure than day and night,
    Himself, his Maker, and the angel Death.
_Complaint. Ed. 1852. The Good Great Man. Ed. 1893._
    My eyes make pictures when they are shut.
_A Day-Dream._
    To know, to esteem, to love, and then to part,
    Makes up life's tale to many a feeling heart!
_On taking Leave of ----, 1817._
    In many ways doth the full heart reveal
    The presence of the love it would conceal.
_Motto to Poems written in Later Life._
    Nought cared this body for wind or weather
    When youth and I lived in 't together.
_Youth and Age._
    Flowers are lovely; love is flower-like;
    Friendship is a sheltering tree;
    Oh the joys that came down shower-like,
    Of friendship, love, and liberty,
                  Ere I was old!
_Youth and Age._
    I have heard of reasons manifold
      Why Love must needs be blind,
    But this the best of all I hold,
      His eyes are in his mind.
_To a Lady, Offended by a Sportive Observation._
    What outward form and feature are
      He guesseth but in part;
    But what within is good and fair
      He seeth with the heart.
_To a Lady, Offended by a Sportive Observation._
    Be that blind bard who on the Chian strand,
    By those deep sounds possessed with inward light,
    Beheld the Iliad and the Odyssey
    Rise to the swelling of the voiceful sea.
_Fancy in Nubibus._
    I counted two-and-seventy stenches,
    All well defined, and several stinks.
_Cologne._
    The river Rhine, it is well known,
    Doth wash your city of Cologne;
    But tell me, nymphs! what power divine
    Shall henceforth wash the river Rhine?
_Cologne._
    Strongly it bears us along in swelling and limitless billows;
    Nothing before and nothing behind but the sky and the ocean.
_The Homeric Hexameter._ (Translated from Schiller.)
    In the hexameter rises the fountain's silvery column,
    In the pentameter aye falling in melody back.
_The Ovidian Elegiac Metre._ (From Schiller.)
    I stood in unimaginable trance
    And agony that cannot be remembered.
_Remorse. Act iv. Sc. 3._
    The intelligible forms of ancient poets,
    The fair humanities of old religion,
    The power, the beauty, and the majesty
    That had their haunts in dale or piny mountain,
    Or forest by slow stream, or pebbly spring,
    Or chasms and watery depths,--all these have vanished;
    They live no longer in the faith of reason.
_Wallenstein. Part i. Act ii. Sc. 4._ (Translated from Schiller.)
    I 've lived and loved.
_Wallenstein. Part i. Act ii. Sc. 6._
    Clothing the palpable and familiar
    With golden exhalations of the dawn.
_The Death of Wallenstein. Act i. Sc. 1._

_Biog. Lit. Chap. xv._
     A dwarf sees farther than the giant when he has the giant's
     shoulder to mount on.
_The Friend. Sec. i. Essay 8._
     An instinctive taste teaches men to build their churches in flat
     countries, with spire steeples, which, as they cannot be referred
     to any other object, point as with silent finger to the sky and
     star.
_Ibid., No. 14._
     Reviewers are usually people who would have been poets,
     historians, biographers, if they could; they have tried their
     talents at one or the other, and have failed; therefore they turn
     critics.
_Lectures on Shakespeare and Milton, p. 36. Delivered 1811-1812._
     Schiller has the material sublime.
_Table Talk._
     I wish our clever young poets would remember my homely
     definitions of prose and poetry; that is, prose,--words in their
     best order; poetry,--the best words in their best order.
_Table Talk._
     That passage is what I call the sublime dashed to pieces by
     cutting too close with the fiery four-in-hand round the corner of
     nonsense.
_Table Talk._
     Iago's soliloquy, the motive-hunting of a motiveless
     malignity--how awful it is!
_Notes on some other Plays of Shakespeare._
JOSIAH QUINCY. 
     If this bill [for the admission of Orleans Territory as a State
     passes, it is my deliberate opinion that it is virtually a
     dissolution of the Union; that it will free the States from their
     moral obligation; and, as it will be the right of all, so it will
     be the duty of some, definitely to prepare for a
     separation,--amicably if they can, violently if they must.

    With whom I converse day by day.

      A-walking the Devil is gone,
    To look at his little snug farm of the World,
      And see how his stock went on.
_The Devil's Walk. Stanza 1._
    He passed a cottage with a double coach-house,
      A cottage of gentility;
        And he owned with a grin,
        That his favourite sin
      Is pride that apes humility.
_The Devil's Walk. Stanza 8._
    Where Washington hath left
      His awful memory
      A light for after times!
_Ode written during the War with America, 1814._
        How beautiful is night!
      A dewy freshness fills the silent air;
    No mist obscures; nor cloud, or speck, nor stain,
      Breaks the serene of heaven:
      In full-orbed glory, yonder moon divine
      Rolls through the dark blue depths;
        Beneath her steady ray
        The desert circle spreads
    Like the round ocean, girdled with the sky.
        How beautiful is night!
_Thalaba. Book i. Stanza 1._
    "But what good came of it at last?"
    Quoth little Peterkin.
    "Why, that I cannot tell," said he;
    "But 't was a famous victory."
_The Battle of Blenheim._
    Blue, darkly, deeply, beautifully blue.
_Madoc in Wales. Part i. 5._
    What will not woman, gentle woman dare,
    When strong affection stirs her spirit up?
_Madoc in Wales. Part ii. 2._
        And last of all an Admiral came,
      A terrible man with a terrible name,
    A name which you all know by sight very well,
    But which no one can speak, and no one can spell.
_The March to Moscow. Stanza 8._
    They sin who tell us love can die;
    With life all other passions fly,
      All others are but vanity.
          .      .      .      .      .
                  Love is indestructible,
      Its holy flame forever burneth;
    From heaven it came, to heaven returneth.
          .      .      .      .      .
      It soweth here with toil and care,
    But the harvest-time of love is there.
_The Curse of Kehama. Canto x. Stanza 10._
    Oh, when a mother meets on high
      The babe she lost in infancy,
    Hath she not then for pains and fears,
      The day of woe, the watchful night,
      For all her sorrow, all her tears,
      An over-payment of delight?
_The Curse of Kehama. Canto x. Stanza 11._
    Thou hast been called, O sleep! the friend of woe;
    But 't is the happy that have called thee so.

     For with G. D., to be absent from the body is sometimes (not to
     speak profanely) to be present with the Lord.
_Oxford in the Vacation._

_Valentine's Day._
     The pilasters reaching down were adorned with a glistering
     substance (I know not what) under glass (as it seemed),
     resembling--a homely fancy, but I judged it to be sugar-candy;
     yet to my raised imagination, divested of its homelier qualities,
     it appeared a glorified candy.
_My First Play._
     Presents, I often say, endear absents.

_Hester. Stanza 7._
    I have had playmates, I have had companions,
    In my days of childhood, in my joyful school-days.
    All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.

    To that dry drudgery at the desk's dead wood?

    Sabbathless Satan!
_Work._
    I like you and your book, ingenious Hone!
      In whose capacious all-embracing leaves
    The very marrow of tradition 's shown;
      And all that history, much that fiction weaves.

_Lamb's Suppers._
     Returning to town in the stage-coach, which was filled with Mr.
     Gilman's guests, we stopped for a minute or two at Kentish Town.
     A woman asked the coachman, "Are you full inside?" Upon which
     Lamb put his head through the window and said, "I am quite full
     inside; that last piece of pudding at Mr. Gilman's did the
     business for me."

    I saw them go: one horse was blind,
    The tails of both hung down behind,
      Their shoes were on their feet.

    Rose Aylmer, whom these wakeful eyes
      May weep, but never see,
    A night of memories and of sighs
      I consecrate to thee.
_Rose Aylmer._
    Wearers of rings and chains!
    Pray do not take the pains
      To set me right.
    In vain my faults ye quote;
    I write as others wrote
      On Sunium's hight.
_The last Fruit of an old Tree. Epigram cvi._
    Shakespeare is not our poet, but the world's,
    Therefore on him no speech! And brief for thee,
    Browning! Since Chaucer was alive and hale,
    No man hath walk'd along our roads with steps
    So active, so inquiring eye, or tongue
    So varied in discourse.
_To Robert Browning._
    The Siren waits thee, singing song for song.
_To Robert Browning._
    But I have sinuous shells of pearly hue
    Within, and they that lustre have imbibed
    In the sun's palace-porch, where when unyoked
    His chariot-wheel stands midway in the wave:
    Shake one, and it awakens; then apply
    Its polisht lips to your attentive ear,
    And it remembers its august abodes,
    And murmurs as the ocean murmurs there.
_Gebir. Book i._ (1798).
    Past are three summers since she first beheld
    The ocean; all around the child await
    Some exclamation of amazement here.
    She coldly said, her long-lasht eyes abased,
    _Is this the mighty ocean? is this all?_
    That wondrous soul Charoba once possest,
    Capacious, then, as earth or heaven could hold,
    Soul discontented with capacity,
    Is gone (I fear) forever. Need I say
    She was enchanted by the wicked spells
    Of Gebir, whom with lust of power inflamed
    The western winds have landed on our coast?
    I since have watcht her in lone retreat,
    Have heard her sigh and soften out the name.
_Gebir. Book ii._
    I strove with none, for none was worth my strife;
      Nature I loved; and next to Nature, Art.
    I warm'd both hands against the fire of life;
      It sinks, and I am ready to depart.

    But Hope, the charmer, linger'd still behind.
_Pleasures of Hope. Part i. Line 40._
    O Heaven! he cried, my bleeding country save!
_Pleasures of Hope. Part i. Line 359._
    Hope for a season bade the world farewell,
    And Freedom shriek'd as Kosciusko fell!
_Pleasures of Hope. Part i. Line 381._
    On Prague's proud arch the fires of ruin glow,
    His blood-dyed waters murmuring far below.
_Pleasures of Hope. Part i. Line 385._
    And rival all but Shakespeare's name below.
_Pleasures of Hope. Part i. Line 472._
    Who hath not own'd, with rapture-smitten frame,
    The power of grace, the magic of a name?
_Pleasures of Hope. Part ii. Line 5._
    Without the smile from partial beauty won,
    Oh what were man?--a world without a sun.
_Pleasures of Hope. Part ii. Line 21._
    The world was sad, the garden was a wild,
    And man the hermit sigh'd--till woman smiled.

    While Memory watches o'er the sad review
    Of joys that faded like the morning dew.

    Melt and dispel, ye spectre-doubts, that roll
    Cimmerian darkness o'er the parting soul!
_Pleasures of Hope. Part ii. Line 263._
    O star-eyed Science! hast thou wandered there,
    To waft us home the message of despair?
_Pleasures of Hope. Part ii. Line 325._
    But sad as angels for the good man's sin,
    Weep to record, and blush to give it in.
_Pleasures of Hope. Part ii. Line 357._
    Cease, every joy, to glimmer on my mind,
    But leave, oh leave the light of Hope behind!
    What though my winged hours of bliss have been
    Like angel visits, few and far between.
_Pleasures of Hope. Part ii. Line 375._
    The hunter and the deer a shade.
_O'Connor's Child. Stanza 5._
    Another's sword has laid him low,
      Another's and another's;
    And every hand that dealt the blow
      Ah me! it was a brother's!
_O'Connor's Child. Stanza 10._
    'T is the sunset of life gives me mystical lore,
    And coming events cast their shadows before.
_Lochiel's Warning._
    Shall victor exult, or in death be laid low,
    With his back to the field and his feet to the foe,
    And leaving in battle no blot on his name,
    Look proudly to heaven from the death-bed of fame.
_Lochiel's Warning._
    And rustic life and poverty
    Grow beautiful beneath his touch.

    Ye mariners of England,
    That guard our native seas;
    Whose flag has braved, a thousand years,
    The battle and the breeze!
_Ye Mariners of England._
    Britannia needs no bulwarks,
    No towers along the steep;
    Her march is o'er the mountain waves,
    Her home is on the deep.
_Ye Mariners of England._
    When the stormy winds do blow;
    When the battle rages loud and long,
    And the stormy winds do blow.
_Ye Mariners of England._
    The meteor flag of England
    Shall yet terrific burn,
    Till danger's troubled night depart,
    And the star of peace return.
_Ye Mariners of England._
    There was silence deep as death,
    And the boldest held his breath
    For a time.
_Battle of the Baltic._
    The combat deepens. On, ye brave,
    Who rush to glory or the grave!
    Wave, Munich! all thy banners wave,
    And charge with all thy chivalry!
_Hohenlinden._
    Few, few shall part where many meet!
    The snow shall be their winding-sheet,
    And every turf beneath their feet
    Shall be a soldier's sepulchre.
_Hohenlinden._
    There came to the beach a poor exile of Erin,
      The dew on his thin robe was heavy and chill;
    For his country he sigh'd, when at twilight repairing
      To wander alone by the wind-beaten hill.

    And the voice in my dreaming ear melted away.
_The Soldier's Dream._
    Triumphal arch, that fill'st the sky
      When storms prepare to part,
    I ask not proud Philosophy
      To teach me what thou art.

    A stoic of the woods,--a man without a tear.
_Gertrude of Wyoming. Part i. Stanza 23._

    The torrent's smoothness, ere it dash below!
_Gertrude of Wyoming. Part iii. Stanza 5._
    Again to the battle, Achaians!
    Our hearts bid the tyrants defiance!
    Our land, the first garden of Liberty's tree,
    It has been, and shall yet be, the land of the free.
_Song of the Greeks._
    Drink ye to her that each loves best!
      And if you nurse a flame

     Government is a trust, and the officers of the government are
     trustees; and both the trust and the trustees are created for the

    Then conquer we must when our cause it is just,

_To the Lord Viscount Forbes, written from the City of Washington._
    How shall we rank thee upon glory's page,
    Thou more than soldier, and just less than sage?
_To Thomas Hume._
    I knew, by the smoke that so gracefully curl'd
      Above the green elms, that a cottage was near;
    And I said, "If there 's peace to be found in the world,
      A heart that was humble might hope for it here."

     The minds of some of our statesmen, like the pupil of the human

     shed upon them.
_Preface to Corruption and Intolerance._
    Like a young eagle who has lent his plume
    To fledge the shaft by which he meets his doom,

    Oh, breathe not his name! let it sleep in the shade,
    Where cold and unhonour'd his relics are laid,
_Oh breathe not his Name._
    And the tear that we shed, though in secret it rolls,
    Shall long keep his memory green in our souls.
_Oh breathe not his Name._
    The harp that once through Tara's halls
      The soul of music shed,
    Now hangs as mute on Tara's walls
      As if that soul were fled.
    So sleeps the pride of former days,
      So glory's thrill is o'er;
    And hearts that once beat high for praise
      Now feel that pulse no more.
_The Harp that once through Tara's Halls._
                              Who ran

_On the Death of Sheridan._
    Whose wit in the combat, as gentle as bright,
    Ne'er carried a heart-stain away on its blade.
_On the Death of Sheridan._
    Good at a fight, but better at a play;
    Godlike in giving, but the devil to pay.
_On a Cast of Sheridan's Hand._
    Though an angel should write, still 't is devils must print.
_The Fudges in England. Letter iii._
    Fly not yet; 't is just the hour
    When pleasure, like the midnight flower
    That scorns the eye of vulgar light,
    Begins to bloom for sons of night
      And maids who love the moon.
_Fly not yet._
          Oh stay! oh stay!
    Joy so seldom weaves a chain
    Like this to-night, that oh 't is pain
      To break its links so soon.
_Fly not yet._
    When did morning ever break,
    And find such beaming eyes awake?
_Fly not yet._
    And the heart that is soonest awake to the flowers
      Is always the first to be touch'd by the thorns.
_Oh think not my Spirits are always as light._
    Rich and rare were the gems she wore,
    And a bright gold ring on her wand she bore.

              When to Eveleen's bower
    The lord of the valley with false vows came.
_Eveleen's Bower._
    Shall I ask the brave soldier who fights by my side
    In the cause of mankind, if our creeds agree?
_Come, send round the Wine._
    No, the heart that has truly lov'd never forgets,
      But as truly loves on to the close;
    As the sunflower turns on her god when he sets
      The same look which she turn'd when he rose.
_Believe me, if all those endearing young Charms._
              The moon looks

_While gazing on the Moon's Light._
    And when once the young heart of a maiden is stolen,
      The maiden herself will steal after it soon.
_Ill Omens._
    'T is sweet to think that where'er we rove
      We are sure to find something blissful and dear;
    And that when we 're far from the lips we love,
      We 've but to make love to the lips we are near.
_'T is sweet to think._
    'T is believ'd that this harp which I wake now for thee
    Was a siren of old who sung under the sea.
_The Origin of the Harp._
    But there 's nothing half so sweet in life
      As love's young dream.
_Love's Young Dream._
    To live with them is far less sweet
      Than to remember thee.
_I saw thy Form._
    Eyes of unholy blue.
_By that Lake whose gloomy Shore._
    'T is the last rose of summer,
      Left blooming alone.
_The Last Rose of Summer._
    When true hearts lie wither'd
      And fond ones are flown,
    Oh, who would inhabit
      This bleak world alone?
_The Last Rose of Summer._
                 And the best of all ways
                 To lengthen our days
    Is to steal a few hours from the night, my dear.
_The Young May Moon._
    You may break, you may shatter the vase if you will,
    But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.
_Farewell! But whenever you welcome the Hour._
    Thus, when the lamp that lighted
      The traveller at first goes out,
    He feels awhile benighted,
      And looks around in fear and doubt.
    But soon, the prospect clearing,
      By cloudless starlight on he treads,
    And thinks no lamp so cheering
      As that light which Heaven sheds.
_I 'd mourn the Hopes._
    No eye to watch, and no tongue to wound us,
    All earth forgot, and all heaven around us.
_Come o'er the Sea._
    The light that lies
    In woman's eyes.
_The Time I 've lost in wooing._
            My only books
            Were woman's looks,
    And folly 's all they 've taught me.
_The Time I 've lost in wooing._
    I know not, I ask not, if guilt 's in that heart,
    I but know that I love thee whatever thou art.
_Come, rest in this Bosom._
    To live and die in scenes like this,
      With some we 've left behind us.
_As slow our Ship._
    Wert thou all that I wish thee, great, glorious, and free,
    First flower of the earth and first gem of the sea.
_Remember Thee._
    All that 's bright must fade,
      The brightest still the fleetest;
    All that 's sweet was made
      But to be lost when sweetest.
_All that 's Bright must fade._
    Those evening bells! those evening bells!
    How many a tale their music tells
    Of youth and home, and that sweet time
    When last I heard their soothing chime!
_Those Evening Bells._
    Oft in the stilly night,
      Ere slumber's chain has bound me,
    Fond memory brings the light
      Of other days around me;
        The smiles, the tears,
        Of boyhood's years,
    The words of love then spoken;
        The eyes that shone
        Now dimmed and gone,
    The cheerful hearts now broken.
_Oft in the Stilly Night._
        I feel like one
        Who treads alone
    Some banquet-hall deserted,
        Whose lights are fled,
        Whose garlands dead,
    And all but he departed.
_Oft in the Stilly Night._
    As half in shade and half in sun
      This world along its path advances,
    May that side the sun 's upon
      Be all that e'er shall meet thy glances!
_Peace be around Thee._
    If I speak to thee in friendship's name,
      Thou think'st I speak too coldly;
    If I mention love's devoted flame,
      Thou say'st I speak too boldly.
_How shall I woo?_
    A friendship that like love is warm;
      A love like friendship, steady.
_How shall I woo?_
    The bird let loose in Eastern skies,
      Returning fondly home,
    Ne'er stoops to earth her wing, nor flies
      Where idle warblers roam;
    But high she shoots through air and light,
      Above all low delay,
    Where nothing earthly bounds her flight,
      Nor shadow dims her way.
_Oh that I had Wings._
    This world is all a fleeting show,
      For man's illusion given;
    The smiles of joy, the tears of woe,
    Deceitful shine, deceitful flow,
      There 's nothing true but Heaven.
_This World is all a fleeting Show._
    Sound the loud timbrel o'er Egypt's dark sea!
    Jehovah has triumph'd,--his people are free.
_Sound the loud Timbrel._
    As down in the sunless retreats of the ocean
      Sweet flowers are springing no mortal can see,
    So deep in my soul the still prayer of devotion,
      Unheard by the world, rises silent to Thee.
    As still to the star of its worship, though clouded,
      The needle points faithfully o'er the dim sea,
    So dark when I roam in this wintry world shrouded,
      The hope of my spirit turns trembling to Thee.
_The Heart's Prayer._
    Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish;
    Earth has no sorrow that Heaven cannot heal.
_Come, ye Disconsolate._
    Oh call it by some better name,
      For friendship sounds too cold.
_Oh call it by some better Name._
    When twilight dews are falling soft
      Upon the rosy sea, love,
    I watch the star whose beam so oft
      Has lighted me to thee, love.
_When Twilight Dews._
    I give thee all,--I can no more,
      Though poor the off'ring be;
    My heart and lute are all the store
      That I can bring to thee.
_My Heart and Lute._
    Who has not felt how sadly sweet
      The dream of home, the dream of home,
    Steals o'er the heart, too soon to fleet,
      When far o'er sea or land we roam?
_The Dream of Home._
    To Greece we give our shining blades.
_Evenings in Greece. First Evening._
    When thus the heart is in a vein
    Of tender thought, the simplest strain
    Can touch it with peculiar power.
_Evenings in Greece. First Evening._
    If thou would'st have me sing and play
      As once I play'd and sung,
    First take this time-worn lute away,
      And bring one freshly strung.
_If Thou would'st have Me sing and play._
    To sigh, yet feel no pain;
      To weep, yet scarce know why;
    To sport an hour with Beauty's chain,
      Then throw it idly by.
_The Blue Stocking._
    Ay, down to the dust with them, slaves as they are!
      From this hour let the blood in their dastardly veins,
    That shrunk at the first touch of Liberty's war,
      Be wasted for tyrants, or stagnate in chains.
_On the Entry of the Austrians into Naples, 1821._
    This narrow isthmus 'twixt two boundless seas,
    The past, the future,--two eternities!
_Lalla Rookh. The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan._
    But Faith, fanatic Faith, once wedded fast
    To some dear falsehood, hugs it to the last.
_Lalla Rookh. The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan._
    There 's a bower of roses by Bendemeer's stream.
_Lalla Rookh. The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan._
    Like the stain'd web that whitens in the sun,
    Grow pure by being purely shone upon.
_Lalla Rookh. The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan._
    One morn a Peri at the gate
    Of Eden stood disconsolate.
_Paradise and the Peri._
    Take all the pleasures of all the spheres,
    And multiply each through endless years,
    One minute of heaven is worth them all.
_Paradise and the Peri._
    But the trail of the serpent is over them all.
_Paradise and the Peri._
    Oh, ever thus, from childhood's hour,
      I 've seen my fondest hopes decay;
    I never loved a tree or flower
      But 't was the first to fade away.
    I never nurs'd a dear gazelle,
      To glad me with its soft black eye,
    But when it came to know me well
      And love me, it was sure to die.
_The Fire-Worshippers._
    Oh for a tongue to curse the slave
      Whose treason, like a deadly blight,
    Comes o'er the councils of the brave,
      And blasts them in their hour of might!
_The Fire-Worshippers._
    Beholding heaven, and feeling hell.
_The Fire-Worshippers._
    As sunshine broken in the rill,
    Though turned astray, is sunshine still.
_The Fire-Worshippers._
    Farewell, farewell to thee, Araby's daughter!
    Thus warbled a Peri beneath the dark sea.
_The Fire-Worshippers._
    Alas! how light a cause may move
    Dissension between hearts that love!
    Hearts that the world in vain had tried,
    And sorrow but more closely tied;
    That stood the storm when waves were rough,
    Yet in a sunny hour fall off,
    Like ships that have gone down at sea
    When heaven was all tranquillity.
_Lalla Rookh. The Light of the Harem._
    Love on through all ills, and love on till they die.
_Lalla Rookh. The Light of the Harem._
    And oh if there be an Elysium on earth,
            It is this, it is this!
_Lalla Rookh. The Light of the Harem._
    Humility, that low, sweet root
    From which all heavenly virtues shoot.
_The Loves of the Angels. The Third Angel's Story._
LORD DENMAN. 1779-1854.
     A delusion, a mockery, and a snare.
_O'Connell v. The Queen, 11 Clark and Finnelly Reports._
     The mere repetition of the _Cantilena_ of lawyers cannot make it
     law, unless it can be traced to some competent authority; and if
     it be irreconcilable, to some clear legal principle.
_O'Connell v. The Queen, 11 Clark and Finnelly Reports._
CLEMENT C. MOORE. 1779-1863.
    'T was the night before Christmas, when all through the house
    Not a creature was stirring,--not even a mouse;
    The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
    In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.
_A Visit from St. Nicholas._
LORD BROUGHAM. 1779-1868.
     Let the soldier be abroad if he will, he can do nothing in this
     age. There is another personage,--a personage less imposing in
     the eyes of some, perhaps insignificant. The schoolmaster is
     abroad, and I trust to him, armed with his primer, against the
     soldier in full military array.
_Speech, Jan. 29, 1828._
     In my mind, he was guilty of no error, he was chargeable with no
     exaggeration, he was betrayed by his fancy into no metaphor, who
     once said that all we see about us, kings, lords, and Commons,
     the whole machinery of the State, all the apparatus of the
     system, and its varied workings, end in simply bringing twelve
     good men into a box.
_Present State of the Law, Feb. 7, 1828._
     Pursuit of knowledge under difficulties.
     Death was now armed with a new terror.
PAUL MOON JAMES. 1780-1854.
    The scene was more beautiful far to the eye
      Than if day in its pride had arrayed it.
_The Beacon._
    And o'er them the lighthouse looked lovely as hope,
      That star of life's tremulous ocean.
_The Beacon._
CHARLES MINER. 1780-1865.
     When I see a merchant over-polite to his customers, begging them
     to taste a little brandy and throwing half his goods on the
     counter,--thinks I, that man has an axe to grind.
_Who 'll turn Grindstones._
JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1782-1850.
     The very essence of a free government consists in considering
     offices as public trusts,[529-1] bestowed for the good of the
     country, and not for the benefit of an individual or a party.
_Speech, Feb. 13, 1835._
     A power has risen up in the government greater than the people
     themselves, consisting of many and various and powerful
     interests, combined into one mass, and held together by the
     cohesive power of the vast surplus in the banks.
_Speech, May 27, 1836._
DANIEL WEBSTER. 1782-1852.
(_From Webster's Works. Boston. 1857._)
     Whatever makes men good Christians, makes them good citizens.
_Speech at Plymouth, Dec. 22, 1820._[529-3] _Vol. i. p. 44._
     We wish that this column, rising towards heaven among the pointed
     spires of so many temples dedicated to God, may contribute also
     to produce in all minds a pious feeling of dependence and
     gratitude. We wish, finally, that the last object to the sight of
     him who leaves his native shore, and the first to gladden his who
     revisits it, may be something which shall remind him of the
     liberty and the glory of his country. Let it rise! let it rise,
     till it meet the sun in his coming; let the earliest light of the
     morning gild it, and parting day linger and play on its summit!
_Address on laying the Corner-Stone of the Bunker Hill Monument, 1825. P.
62._
     Venerable men! you have come down to us from a former generation.
     Heaven has bounteously lengthened out your lives, that you might
     behold this joyous day.
_Address on laying the Corner-Stone of the Bunker Hill Monument, 1825.
Vol. i. p. 64._
     Mind is the great lever of all things; human thought is the
     process by which human ends are ultimately answered.
_Address on laying the Corner-Stone of the Bunker Hill Monument, 1825.
Vol. i. p. 71._
     Knowledge, in truth, is the great sun in the firmament. Life and
     power are scattered with all its beams.
_Address on laying the Corner-Stone of the Bunker Hill Monument, 1825.
Vol. i. p. 74._
     Let our object be our country, our whole country, and nothing but
     our country.
_Address on laying the Corner-Stone of the Bunker Hill Monument, 1825.
Vol. i. p. 78._
     Knowledge is the only fountain both of the love and the
     principles of human liberty.
_Completion of Bunker Hill Monument, June 17, 1843. P. 93._
     The Bible is a book of faith, and a book of doctrine, and a book
     of morals, and a book of religion, of especial revelation from
     God.
_Completion of Bunker Hill Monument, June 17, 1843. P. 102._
     America has furnished to the world the character of Washington.
     And if our American institutions had done nothing else, that
     alone would have entitled them to the respect of mankind.
_Completion of Bunker Hill Monument, June 17, 1843. P. 105._
     Thank God! I--I also--am an American!
_Completion of Bunker Hill Monument, June 17, 1843. P. 107._
     Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I give my hand and
     my heart to this vote.
_Eulogy on Adams and Jefferson, Aug. 2, 1826. P. 133._
     It is my living sentiment, and by the blessing of God it shall be
     my dying sentiment,--Independence now and Independence
     forever.
_Eulogy on Adams and Jefferson, Aug. 2, 1826. Vol. i. p. 136._
     Although no sculptured marble should rise to their memory, nor
     engraved stone bear record of their deeds, yet will their
     remembrance be as lasting as the land they honored.
_Eulogy on Adams and Jefferson, Aug. 2, 1826. Vol. i. p. 146._
     Washington is in the clear upper sky.
_Eulogy on Adams and Jefferson, Aug. 2, 1826. Vol. i. p. 148._
     He smote the rock of the national resources, and abundant streams
     of revenue gushed forth. He touched the dead corpse of Public
     Credit, and it sprung upon its feet.
_Speech on Hamilton, March 10, 1831. P. 200._
     One country, one constitution, one destiny.
_Speech, March 15, 1837. P. 349._
     When tillage begins, other arts follow. The farmers therefore are
     the founders of human civilization.
_Remarks on Agriculture, Jan. 13, 1840. P. 457._
     Sea of upturned faces.
_Speech, Sept. 30, 1842. Vol. ii. p. 117._
     Justice, sir, is the great interest of man on earth.
_On Mr. Justice Story, 1845. P. 300._
     Liberty exists in proportion to wholesome restraint.
_Speech at the Charleston Bar Dinner, May 10, 1847. Vol. ii. p. 393._
     The law: It has honored us; may we honor it.
_Toast at the Charleston Bar Dinner, May 10, 1847. Vol. ii. p. 394._
     I have read their platform, and though I think there are some
     unsound places in it, I can stand upon it pretty well. But I see
     nothing in it both new and valuable. "What is valuable is not
     new, and what is new is not valuable."
_Speech at Marshfield, Sept. 1, 1848. P. 433._
     Labour in this country is independent and proud. It has not to
     ask the patronage of capital, but capital solicits the aid of
     labor.
_Speech, April, 1824. Vol. iii. p. 141._
     The gentleman has not seen how to reply to this, otherwise than
     by supposing me to have advanced the doctrine that a national
     debt is a national blessing.
_Second Speech on Foot's Resolution, Jan. 26, 1830. P. 303._
     I thank God, that if I am gifted with little of the spirit which
     is able to raise mortals to the skies, I have yet none, as I
     trust, of that other spirit which would drag angels down.
_Second Speech on Foot's Resolution, Jan. 26, 1830. P. 316._
     I shall enter on no encomium upon Massachusetts; she needs none.
     There she is. Behold her, and judge for yourselves. There is her
     history; the world knows it by heart. The past, at least, is
     secure. There is Boston and Concord and Lexington and Bunker
     Hill; and there they will remain forever.
_Second Speech on Foot's Resolution, Jan. 26, 1830. P. 317._
     The people's government, made for the people, made by the people,
     and answerable to the people.
_Second Speech on Foot's Resolution, Jan. 26, 1830. P. 321._
     When my eyes shall be turned to behold for the last time the sun
     in heaven, may I not see him shining on the broken and dishonored
     fragments of a once glorious Union; on States dissevered,
     discordant, belligerent; on a land rent with civil feuds, or
     drenched, it may be, in fraternal blood.
_Second Speech on Foot's Resolution, Jan. 26, 1830. Vol. iii. p. 342._
     Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.
_Second Speech on Foot's Resolution, Jan. 26, 1830. Vol. iii. p. 342._
     God grants liberty only to those who love it, and are always
     ready to guard and defend it.
_Speech, June 3, 1834. Vol. iv. p. 47._
     On this question of principle, while actual suffering was yet
     afar off, they [the Colonies] raised their flag against a power
     to which, for purposes of foreign conquest and subjugation, Rome
     in the height of her glory is not to be compared,--a power which
     has dotted over the surface of the whole globe with her
     possessions and military posts, whose morning drum-beat,
     following the sun,[533-1] and keeping company with the hours,
     circles the earth with one continuous and unbroken strain of the
     martial airs of England.
_Speech, May 7, 1834. P. 110._
     Inconsistencies of opinion, arising from changes of
     circumstances, are often justifiable.
_Speech, July 25 and 27, 1846. Vol. v. p. 187._
     I was born an American; I will live an American; I shall die an
     American.
_Speech, July 17, 1850. P. 437._
     There is no refuge from confession but suicide; and suicide is
     confession.
_Argument on the Murder of Captain White, April 6, 1830. Vol. vi. p. 54._
     There is nothing so powerful as truth,--and often nothing so
     strange.
_Argument on the Murder of Captain White. Vol. vi. p. 68._
     Fearful concatenation of circumstances.
_Argument on the Murder of Captain White. Vol. vi. p. 88._
     A sense of duty pursues us ever. It is omnipresent, like the
     Deity. If we take to ourselves the wings of the morning, and
     dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, duty performed or duty
     violated is still with us, for our happiness or our misery. If we
     say the darkness shall cover us, in the darkness as in the light
     our obligations are yet with us.
_Argument on the Murder of Captain White. Vol. vi. p. 105._
     I shall defer my visit to Faneuil Hall, the cradle of American
     liberty, until its doors shall fly open on golden hinges to
     lovers of Union as well as lovers of liberty.
_Letter, April, 1851._
JANE TAYLOR. 1783-1824.
    Though man a thinking being is defined,
    Few use the grand prerogative of mind.
    How few think justly of the thinking few!
    How many never think, who think they do!
_Essays in Rhyme._ (_On Morals and Manners. Prejudice._) _Essay i. Stanza

    Far from mortal cares retreating,
      Sordid hopes and vain desires,
    Here, our willing footsteps meeting,
      Every heart to heaven aspires.
_Hymn._
    I thank the goodness and the grace
      Which on my birth have smiled,
    And made me, in these Christian days,
      A happy Christian child.
_A Child's Hymn of Praise._
    Oh that it were my chief delight
      To do the things I ought!
    Then let me try with all my might
      To mind what I am taught.
_For a Very Little Child._
    Who ran to help me when I fell,
    And would some pretty story tell,
    Or kiss the place to make it well?
                            My mother.
_My Mother._
REGINALD HEBER. 1783-1826.
    Failed the bright promise of your early day.
_Palestine._
    No hammers fell, no ponderous axes rung;
    Like some tall palm the mystic fabric sprung.
    Majestic silence!
_Palestine._
    Brightest and best of the sons of the morning,
    Dawn on our darkness, and lend us thine aid.
_Epiphany._
    By cool Siloam's shady rill
      How sweet the lily grows!

_Seventh Sunday after Trinity._
    Death rides on every passing breeze,
      He lurks in every flower.
_At a Funeral. No. i._
    Thou art gone to the grave; but we will not deplore thee,
    Though sorrows and darkness encompass the tomb.
_At a Funeral. No. ii._
    Thus heavenly hope is all serene,
      But earthly hope, how bright soe'er,
    Still fluctuates o'er this changing scene,
      As false and fleeting as 't is fair.
_On Heavenly Hope and Earthly Hope._
    From Greenland's icy mountains,
      From India's coral strand,
    Where Afric's sunny fountains
      Roll down their golden sand.
_Missionary Hymn._
    Though every prospect pleases,
      And only man is vile.
_Missionary Hymn._
    I see them on their winding way,
    About their ranks the moonbeams play.
_Lines written to a March._
WASHINGTON IRVING. 1783-1859.
     Free-livers on a small scale, who are prodigal within the compass
     of a guinea.
_The Stout Gentleman._
     The almighty dollar,[536-1] that great object of universal
     devotion throughout our land, seems to have no genuine devotees
     in these peculiar villages.
_The Creole Village._
LEIGH HUNT. 1784-1859.
    Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)
    Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace.
_Abou Ben Adhem._
    Write me as one who loves his fellow-men.
_Abou Ben Adhem._
    And lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.
_Abou Ben Adhem._
    Oh for a seat in some poetic nook,
    Just hid with trees and sparkling with a brook!
_Politics and Poetics._
    With spots of sunny openings, and with nooks
    To lie and read in, sloping into brooks.
_The Story of Rimini._
SAMUEL WOODWORTH. 1785-1842.
    How dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood,
    When fond recollection presents them to view.
_The Old Oaken Bucket._
    Then soon with the emblem of truth overflowing,
    And dripping with coolness, it rose from the well.
_The Old Oaken Bucket._
    The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,
    The moss-covered bucket, which hung in the well.
_The Old Oaken Bucket._
ALLAN CUNNINGHAM. 1785-1842.
    A wet sheet and a flowing sea,
      A wind that follows fast,
    And fills the white and rustling sail,
      And bends the gallant mast.
    And bends the gallant mast, my boys,
      While like the eagle free
    Away the good ship flies, and leaves
      Old England on the lee.
_A Wet Sheet and a Flowing Sea._
    While the hollow oak our palace is,
      Our heritage the sea.
_A Wet Sheet and a Flowing Sea._
    When looks were fond and words were few.
_Poet's Bridal-day Song._
SIR W. F. P. NAPIER. 1785-1860.
     Napoleon's troops fought in bright fields, where every helmet
     caught some gleams of glory; but the British soldier conquered
     under the cool shade of aristocracy. No honours awaited his
     daring, no despatch gave his name to the applauses of his
     countrymen; his life of danger and hardship was uncheered by
     hope, his death unnoticed.
_Peninsular War_ (1810). _Vol. ii. Book xi. Chap. iii._
JOHN PIERPONT. 1785-1866.
    A weapon that comes down as still
      As snowflakes fall upon the sod;
    But executes a freeman's will,
      As lightning does the will of God;
    And from its force nor doors nor locks
    Can shield you,--'t is the ballot-box.
_A Word from a Petitioner._
    From every place below the skies
      The grateful song, the fervent prayer,
    The incense of the heart,[538-1]--may rise
      To heaven, and find acceptance there.
_Every Place a Temple._
BRYAN W. PROCTER. 1787-1874.
    The sea! the sea! the open sea!
    The blue, the fresh, the ever free!
_The Sea._
    I 'm on the sea! I 'm on the sea!
    I am where I would ever be,
    With the blue above and the blue below,
    And silence wheresoe'er I go.
_The Sea._
    I never was on the dull, tame shore,
    But I loved the great sea more and more.
_The Sea._
    Touch us gently, Time!
      Let us glide adown thy stream
    Gently,--as we sometimes glide
      Through a quiet dream.
_Touch us gently, Time._
LORD BYRON 1788-1824.
    Farewell! if ever fondest prayer
      For other's weal avail'd on high,
    Mine will not all be lost in air,
      But waft thy name beyond the sky.
_Farewell! if ever fondest Prayer._
    I only know we loved in vain;
      I only feel--farewell! farewell!
_Farewell! if ever fondest Prayer._
    When we two parted
      In silence and tears,
    Half broken-hearted,
      To sever for years.
_When we Two parted._
    Fools are my theme, let satire be my song.

    'T is pleasant, sure, to see one's name in print;

_English Bards and Scotch Reviewers. Line 51._
    With just enough of learning to misquote.
_English Bards and Scotch Reviewers. Line 66._
                               As soon
    Seek roses in December, ice in June;
    Hope constancy in wind, or corn in chaff;
    Believe a woman or an epitaph,

      A spark of that immortal fire
    With angels shared, by Alla given,
      To lift from earth our low desire.
_The Giaour. Line 1127._
    Know ye the land where the cypress and myrtle
      Are emblems of deeds that are done in their clime;
    Where the rage of the vulture, the love of the turtle,
      Now melt into sorrow, now madden to crime?

    The might, the majesty of loveliness?

_Marco Bozzaris._
    Come to the bridal chamber, Death!
      Come to the mother's, when she feels
    For the first time her first-born's breath!
      Come when the blessed seals
    That close the pestilence are broke,
    And crowded cities wail its stroke!
    Come in consumption's ghastly form,
    The earthquake shock, the ocean storm!
    Come when the heart beats high and warm,
      With banquet song, and dance, and wine!

    The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier,
    And all we know or dream or fear
      Of agony are thine.
_Marco Bozzaris._
    But to the hero, when his sword

_The Burial of Sir John Moore._

_To Mary._
    Go, forget me! why should sorrow
      O'er that brow a shadow fling?
    Go, forget me, and to-morrow
      Brightly smile and sweetly sing!
    Smile,--though I shall not be near thee;
    Sing,--though I shall never hear thee!

    Thine azure sister of the spring shall blow
    Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth.
_Ode to the West Wind._
    Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams
      The blue Mediterranean, where he lay,
    Lull'd by the coil of his crystalline streams
      Beside a pumice isle in Baiæ's bay,
    And saw in sleep old palaces and towers
      Quivering within the wave's intenser day,
    All overgrown with azure moss and flowers
      So sweet, the sense faints picturing them.

      Whom mortals call the moon.
_The Cloud. iv._
          We look before and after,
            And pine for what is not;

    Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.

    The work of their own hearts, and this must be
    Our chastisement or recompense.
_Julian and Maddalo. Line 482._

    Peter was dull; he was at first

_Queen Mab. i._
    Power, like a desolating pestilence,

_A Defence of Poetry._
J. HOWARD PAYNE. 1792-1852.
    'Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,
    Be it ever so humble, there 's no place like home;
    A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there,
    Which sought through the world is ne'er met with elsewhere.
    An exile from home splendour dazzles in vain,
    Oh give me my lowly thatched cottage again;
    The birds singing gayly, that came at my call,
    Give me them, and that peace of mind dearer than all.

    The babe was sleeping on her breast.

    Why should we faint and fear to live alone,
      Since all alone, so Heaven has willed, we die?
    Nor even the tenderest heart, and next our own,
      Knows half the reasons why we smile and sigh.
_The Christian Year. Twenty-fourth Sunday after Trinity._
    'T is sweet, as year by year we lose
    Friends out of sight, in faith to muse
    How grows in Paradise our store.
_Burial of the Dead._
    Abide with me from morn till eve,
    For without Thee I cannot live;
    Abide with me when night is nigh,
    For without Thee I dare not die.
_Evening._
FELICIA D. HEMANS. 1794-1835.
    The stately homes of England,
      How beautiful they stand,
    Amid their tall ancestral trees,
      O'er all the pleasant land!
_The Homes of England._
    The breaking waves dashed high
      On a stern and rock-bound coast,
    And the woods against a stormy sky
      Their giant branches tossed.
_Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers._
    What sought they thus afar?
      Bright jewels of the mine,
    The wealth of seas, the spoils of war?
      They sought a faith's pure shrine.
_Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers._
    Ay, call it holy ground,
      The soil where first they trod:
    They have left unstained what there they found,
      Freedom to worship God.
_Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers._
    Through the laburnum's dropping gold
    Rose the light shaft of Orient mould,
    And Europe's violets, faintly sweet,
    Purpled the mossbeds at its feet.
_The Palm-Tree._
    They grew in beauty side by side,
      They filled one home with glee:
    Their graves are severed far and wide
      By mount and stream and sea.
_The Graves of a Household._
    Alas for love, if thou wert all,
      And naught beyond, O Earth!
_The Graves of a Household._
    The boy stood on the burning deck,
      Whence all but him had fled;
    The flame that lit the battle's wreck
      Shone round him o'er the dead.
_Casabianca._
          Leaves have their time to fall,
    And flowers to wither at the north-wind's breath,
          And stars to set; but all,
    Thou hast all seasons for thine own, O Death!
_The Hour of Death._
    Come to the sunset tree!
      The day is past and gone;
    The woodman's axe lies free,
      And the reaper's work is done.
_Tyrolese Evening Song._
    In the busy haunts of men.
_Tale of the Secret Tribunal. Part i._
    Calm on the bosom of thy God,
      Fair spirit, rest thee now!
_Siege of Valencia. Scene ix._
    Oh, call my brother back to me!
      I cannot play alone:
    The summer comes with flower and bee,
      Where is my brother gone?
_The Child's First Grief._
    I have looked on the hills of the stormy North,
    And the larch has hung his tassels forth.
_The Voice of Spring._
    I had a hat. It was not all a hat,
    Part of the brim was gone:
    Yet still I wore it on.
_Rhine Song of the German Soldiers after Victory._
EDWARD EVERETT. 1794-1865.
    When I am dead, no pageant train
      Shall waste their sorrows at my bier,
    Nor worthless pomp of homage vain
      Stain it with hypocritic tear.
_Alaric the Visigoth._
    You shall not pile, with servile toil,
      Your monuments upon my breast,
    Nor yet within the common soil
      Lay down the wreck of power to rest,
    Where man can boast that he has trod
    On him that was "the scourge of God."
_Alaric the Visigoth._
     No gilded dome swells from the lowly roof to catch the morning or
     evening beam; but the love and gratitude of united America settle
     upon it in one eternal sunshine. From beneath that humble roof
     went forth the intrepid and unselfish warrior, the magistrate who
     knew no glory but his country's good; to that he returned,
     happiest when his work was done. There he lived in noble
     simplicity, there he died in glory and peace. While it stands,
     the latest generations of the grateful children of America will
     make this pilgrimage to it as to a shrine; and when it shall
     fall, if fall it must, the memory and the name of Washington
     shall shed an eternal glory on the spot.
_Oration on the Character of Washington._
WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT. 1794-1878.
    Here the free spirit of mankind, at length,
    Throws its last fetters off; and who shall place
    A limit to the giant's unchained strength,
    Or curb his swiftness in the forward race?
_The Ages. xxxiii._
    To him who in the love of Nature holds
    Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
    A various language.
_Thanatopsis._
    Go forth under the open sky, and list
    To Nature's teachings.
_Thanatopsis._
                            The hills,
    Rock-ribbed, and ancient as the sun.
_Thanatopsis._
    Old ocean's gray and melancholy waste.
_Thanatopsis._
                            All that tread
    The globe are but a handful to the tribes
    That slumber in its bosom.
_Thanatopsis._
    So live, that when thy summons comes to join
    The innumerable caravan which moves
    To that mysterious realm where each shall take
    His chamber in the silent halls of death,
    Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,
    Scourged to his dungeon, but sustained and soothed
    By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave
    Like one that wraps the drapery of his couch
    About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.
_Thanatopsis._
    The groves were God's first temples.
_A Forest Hymn._
    The stormy March has come at last,
      With winds and clouds and changing skies;
    I hear the rushing of the blast
      That through the snowy valley flies.
_March._
      But 'neath yon crimson tree
    Lover to listening maid might breathe his flame,
    Nor mark, within its roseate canopy,
      Her blush of maiden shame.
_Autumn Woods._
    The melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year,
    Of wailing winds and naked woods and meadows brown and sear.
_The Death of the Flowers._
    And sighs to find them in the wood and by the stream no more.
_The Death of the Flowers._
    Loveliest of lovely things are they
    On earth that soonest pass away.
    The rose that lives its little hour
    Is prized beyond the sculptured flower.
_A Scene on the Banks of the Hudson._
    The victory of endurance born.
_The Battle-Field._
    Truth crushed to earth shall rise again,
      The eternal years of God are hers;
    But Error, wounded, writhes with pain,
      And dies among his worshippers.
_The Battle-Field._
JOSEPH RODMAN DRAKE. 1795-1820.
    When Freedom from her mountain-height
      Unfurled her standard to the air,
    She tore the azure robe of night,
      And set the stars of glory there.
    She mingled with its gorgeous dyes
    The milky baldric of the skies,
    And striped its pure, celestial white
    With streakings of the morning light.
    Flag of the free heart's hope and home!
      By angel hands to valour given!
    Thy stars have lit the welkin dome,
      And all thy hues were born in heaven.
    Forever float that standard sheet!
      Where breathes the foe but falls before us,
    With Freedom's soil beneath our feet,
      And Freedom's banner streaming o'er us?
_The American Flag._
JOHN KEATS. 1795-1821.
    A thing of beauty is a joy forever;
    Its loveliness increases; it will never
    Pass into nothingness.
_Endymion. Book i._
                     He ne'er is crown'd
    With immortality, who fears to follow
    Where airy voices lead.
_Endymion. Book ii._
        To sorrow
        I bade good-morrow,
    And thought to leave her far away behind;
        But cheerly, cheerly,
        She loves me dearly;
    She is so constant to me, and so kind.
_Endymion. Book iv._
    So many, and so many, and such glee.
_Endymion. Book iv._
    Love in a hut, with water and a crust,
    Is--Love, forgive us!--cinders, ashes, dust.
_Lamia. Part ii._
    There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:
    We know her woof, her texture; she is given
    In the dull catalogue of common things.
    Philosophy will clip an angel's wings.
_Lamia. Part ii._
                        Music's golden tongue
    Flatter'd to tears this aged man and poor.
_The Eve of St. Agnes. Stanza 3._
    The silver snarling trumpets 'gan to chide.
_The Eve of St. Agnes. Stanza 4._
    Asleep in lap of legends old.
_The Eve of St. Agnes. Stanza 15._
    Sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose,
    Flushing his brow.
_The Eve of St. Agnes. Stanza 16._
    A poor, weak, palsy-stricken, churchyard thing.
_The Eve of St. Agnes. Stanza 18._
    As though a rose should shut and be a bud again.
_The Eve of St. Agnes. Stanza 27._
    And lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon.
_The Eve of St. Agnes. Stanza 30._
    He play'd an ancient ditty long since mute,
    In Provence call'd "La belle dame sans mercy."
_The Eve of St. Agnes. Stanza 33._
    That large utterance of the early gods!
_Hyperion. Book i._
    Those green-robed senators of mighty woods,
    Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,
    Dream, and so dream all night without a stir.
_Hyperion. Book i._
    The days of peace and slumberous calm are fled.
_Hyperion. Book ii._
    Dance and Provençal song and sunburnt mirth!
    Oh for a beaker full of the warm South,
    Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene!
    With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,
    And purple-stainèd mouth.
_Ode to a Nightingale._
    Through the sad heart of Ruth, when sick for home
    She stood in tears amid the alien corn;
      The same that ofttimes hath
    Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam
    Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.
_Ode to a Nightingale._
    Thou foster-child of Silence and slow Time.
_Ode on a Grecian Urn._
    Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
      Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on,
    Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,
      Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone.
_Ode on a Grecian Urn._
    Thou, silent form, doth tease us out of thought
      As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!
_Ode on a Grecian Urn._
    Beauty is truth, truth beauty,--that is all
      Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.
_Ode on a Grecian Urn._
    In a drear-nighted December,
      Too happy, happy tree,
    Thy branches ne'er remember
      Their green felicity.
_Stanzas._
                Hear ye not the hum
    Of mighty workings?
_Addressed to Haydon. Sonnet x._
    Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold,
      And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
      Round many western islands have I been
    Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
    Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
      That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne,
      Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
    Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
    Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
      When a new planet swims into his ken;
    Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
      He stared at the Pacific, and all his men
    Look'd at each other with a wild surmise,
      Silent, upon a peak in Darien.
_On first looking into Chapman's Homer._
    E'en like the passage of an angel's tear
    That falls through the clear ether silently.
_To One who has been long in City pent._
    The poetry of earth is never dead.
_On the Grasshopper and Cricket._
    Here lies one whose name was writ in water.
THOMAS NOON TALFOURD. 1795-1854.
                       So his life has flowed
    From its mysterious urn a sacred stream,
    In whose calm depth the beautiful and pure
    Alone are mirrored; which, though shapes of ill
    May hover round its surface, glides in light,
    And takes no shadow from them.
_Ion. Act i. Sc. 1._
                       'T is a little thing
    To give a cup of water; yet its draught
    Of cool refreshment, drained by fevered lips,
    May give a shock of pleasure to the frame
    More exquisite than when nectarean juice
    Renews the life of joy in happiest hours.
_Ion. Act i. Sc. 2._
THOMAS CARLYLE. 1795-1881.
     Except by name, Jean Paul Friedrich Richter is little known out
     of Germany. The only thing connected with him, we think, that has
     reached this country is his saying,--imported by Madame de Staël,
     and thankfully pocketed by most newspaper critics,--"Providence
     has given to the French the empire of the land; to the English
     that of the sea; to the Germans that of--the air!"
_Richter. Edinburgh Review, 1827._
     Literary men are . . . a perpetual priesthood.
_State of German Literature. Edinburgh Review, 1827._
     Clever men are good, but they are not the best.
_Goethe. Edinburgh Review, 1828._
     We are firm believers in the maxim that for all right judgment of
     any man or thing it is useful, nay, essential, to see his good
     qualities before pronouncing on his bad.
_Goethe. Edinburgh Review, 1828._
     How does the poet speak to men with power, but by being still
     more a man than they?
_Burns. Edinburgh Review, 1828._
     A poet without love were a physical and metaphysical
     impossibility.
_Burns. Edinburgh Review, 1828._
     His religion at best is an anxious wish,--like that of Rabelais,
     a great Perhaps.
_Burns. Edinburgh Review, 1828._
     We have oftener than once endeavoured to attach some meaning to
     that aphorism, vulgarly imputed to Shaftesbury, which however we
     can find nowhere in his works, that "ridicule is the test of
     truth."
_Voltaire. Foreign Review, 1829._
     We must repeat the often repeated saying, that it is unworthy a
     religious man to view an irreligious one either with alarm or
     aversion, or with any other feeling than regret and hope and
     brotherly commiseration.
_Voltaire. Foreign Review, 1829._
     There is no heroic poem in the world but is at bottom a
     biography, the life of a man; also it may be said, there is no
     life of a man, faithfully recorded, but is a heroic poem of its
     sort, rhymed or unrhymed.
_Sir Walter Scott. London and Westminster Review, 1838._
     Silence is deep as Eternity, speech is shallow as Time.
_Sir Walter Scott. London and Westminster Review, 1838._
     To the very last, he [Napoleon] had a kind of idea; that, namely,
     of _la carrière ouverte aux talents_,--the tools to him that can
     handle them.
_Sir Walter Scott. London and Westminster Review, 1838._
     Blessed is the healthy nature; it is the coherent, sweetly
     co-operative, not incoherent, self-distracting, self-destructive
     one!
_Sir Walter Scott. London and Westminster Review, 1838._
     The uttered part of a man's life, let us always repeat, bears to
     the unuttered, unconscious part a small unknown proportion. He
     himself never knows it, much less do others.
_Sir Walter Scott. London and Westminster Review, 1838._
     Literature is the Thought of thinking Souls.
_Sir Walter Scott. London and Westminster Review, 1838._
     It can be said of him, when he departed he took a Man's life with
     him. No sounder piece of British manhood was put together in that
     eighteenth century of Time.
_Sir Walter Scott. London and Westminster Review, 1838._
     The eye of the intellect "sees in all objects what it brought
     with it the means of seeing."
_Varnhagen Von Ense's Memoirs. London and Westminster Review, 1838._
     Happy the people whose annals are blank in history-books.
_Life of Frederick the Great. Book xvi. Chap. i._
     As the Swiss inscription says: _Sprechen ist silbern, Schweigen
     ist golden_,--"Speech is silvern, Silence is golden;" or, as I
     might rather express it, Speech is of Time, Silence is of
     Eternity.
_Sartor Resartus. Book iii. Chap. iii._
     The greatest of faults, I should say, is to be conscious of
     none.
_Heroes and Hero-Worship. The Hero as a Prophet._
     In books lies the soul of the whole Past Time: the articulate
     audible voice of the Past, when the body and material substance
     of it has altogether vanished like a dream.
_Heroes and Hero-Worship. The Hero as a Man of Letters._
     The true University of these days is a Collection of Books.
_Heroes and Hero-Worship. The Hero as a Man of Letters._
     One life,--a little gleam of time between two Eternities.
_Heroes and Hero-Worship. The Hero as a Man of Letters._
     Adversity is sometimes hard upon a man; but for one man who can
     stand prosperity there are a hundred that will stand adversity.
_Heroes and Hero-Worship. The Hero as a Man of Letters._
THOMAS C. HALIBURTON. 1796-1865.
     I want you to see Peel, Stanley, Graham, Sheil, Russell,
     Macaulay, Old Joe, and so on. They are all upper-crust
     here.
_Sam Slick In England._[580-2] _Chap. xxiv._
     Circumstances alter cases.
_The Old Judge. Chap. xv._
WILLIAM MOTHERWELL. 1797-1835.
    I 've wandered east, I 've wandered west,
      Through many a weary way;
    But never, never can forget
      The love of life's young day.
_Jeannie Morrison._
    And we, with Nature's heart in tune,
      Concerted harmonies.
_Jeannie Morrison._
THOMAS HAYNES BAYLY. 1797-1839.
    I 'd be a butterfly born in a bower,
      Where roses and lilies and violets meet.
_I 'd be a Butterfly._
    Oh no! we never mention her,
      Her name is never heard;
    My lips are now forbid to speak
      That once familiar word.
_Oh no! we never mention her._
    We met,--'t was in a crowd.
_We met._
    Gayly the troubadour
      Touched his guitar.
_Welcome me Home._
    Why don't the men propose, Mamma?
      Why don't the men propose?
_Why don't the Men propose?_
    She wore a wreath of roses
      The night that first we met.
_She wore a Wreath._
    Friends depart, and memory takes them
      To her caverns, pure and deep.
_Teach me to forget._
    Tell me the tales that to me were so dear,
      Long, long ago, long, long ago.
_Long, long ago._
    The rose that all are praising
      Is not the rose for me.
_The Rose that all are praising._
    Oh pilot, 't is a fearful night!
      There 's danger on the deep.
_The Pilot._
    Fear not, but trust in Providence,
      Wherever thou may'st be.
_The Pilot._
    Absence makes the heart grow fonder:
      Isle of Beauty, fare thee well!
_Isle of Beauty._
    The mistletoe hung in the castle hall,
    The holly-branch shone on the old oak wall.
_The Mistletoe Bough._
    Oh, I have roamed o'er many lands,
      And many friends I 've met;
    Not one fair scene or kindly smile
      Can this fond heart forget.
_Oh, steer my Bark to Erin's Isle._
THOMAS DRUMMOND.[582-1] 1797-1840.
     Property has its duties as well as its rights.
_Letter to the Landlords of Tipperary._
McDONALD CLARKE. 1798-1842.
    Whilst twilight's curtain spreading far,
    Was pinned with a single star.
_Death in Disguise. Line 227._ (Boston edition, 1833.)
SAMUEL LOVER. 1797-1868.
    A baby was sleeping,
    Its mother was weeping.
_The Angel's Whisper._
    Reproof on her lips, but a smile in her eye.
_Rory O'More._
    For drames always go by _conthraries_, my dear.
_Rory O'More._
    "Then here goes another," says he, "to make sure,
    For there 's luck in odd numbers,"[583-1] says Rory O'More.
_Rory O'More._
    There was a place in childhood that I remember well,
    And there a voice of sweetest tone bright fairy tales did tell.
_My Mother dear._
    Sure the shovel and tongs
    To each other belongs.
_Widow Machree._
THOMAS HOOD. 1798-1845.
    There is a silence where hath been no sound,
    There is a silence where no sound may be,
    In the cold grave, under the deep, deep sea,
    Or in the wide desert where no life is found.
_Sonnet. Silence._
    We watch'd her breathing through the night,
      Her breathing soft and low,
    As in her breast the wave of life
      Kept heaving to and fro.
_The Death-Bed._
    Our very hopes belied our fears,
      Our fears our hopes belied;
    We thought her dying when she slept,
      And sleeping when she died.
_The Death-Bed._
    I remember, I remember
    The fir-trees dark and high;
    I used to think their slender tops
    Were close against the sky;
    It was a childish ignorance,
    But now 't is little joy
    To know I 'm farther off from heaven
    Than when I was a boy.
_I remember, I remember._
    She stood breast-high amid the corn
    Clasp'd by the golden light of morn,
    Like the sweetheart of the sun,
    Who many a glowing kiss had won.
_Ruth._
    Thus she stood amid the stooks,
    Praising God with sweetest looks.
_Ruth._
        When he is forsaken,
        Wither'd and shaken,
    What can an old man do but die?
_Spring it is cheery._
    And there is even a happiness
    That makes the heart afraid.
_Ode to Melancholy._
    There 's not a string attuned to mirth
    But has its chord in melancholy.
_Ode to Melancholy._
    But evil is wrought by want of thought,
    As well as want of heart.
_The Lady's Dream._
    Oh would I were dead now,
    Or up in my bed now,
    To cover my head now,
      And have a good cry!
_A Table of Errata._
    Straight down the crooked lane,
    And all round the square.
_A Plain Direction._
    For my part, getting up seems not so easy
          By half as _lying_.
_Morning Meditations._
    A man that 's fond precociously of _stirring_
          Must be a spoon.
_Morning Meditations._
    Seem'd washing his hands with invisible soap
      In imperceptible water.
_Miss Kilmansegg. Her Christening._
    O bed! O bed! delicious bed!
    That heaven upon earth to the weary head!
_Her Dream._
    He lies like a hedgehog rolled up the wrong way,
      Tormenting himself with his prickles.
_Her Dream._
    Gold! Gold! Gold! Gold!
    Bright and yellow, hard and cold.
_Her Moral._
    Spurn'd by the young, but hugg'd by the old
    To the very verge of the churchyard mould.
_Her Moral._
      How widely its agencies vary,
    To save, to ruin, to curse, to bless,
    As even its minted coins express,
    Now stamp'd with the image of Good Queen Bess,
      And now of a Bloody Mary.
_Her Moral._
    Another tumble! That 's his precious nose!
_Parental Ode to my Infant Son._
    Boughs are daily rifled
      By the gusty thieves,
    And the book of Nature
      Getteth short of leaves.
_The Season._
    With fingers weary and worn,
      With eyelids heavy and red,
    A woman sat in unwomanly rags
      Plying her needle and thread,
        Stitch! Stitch! Stitch!
_The Song of the Shirt._
    O men with sisters dear,
      O men with mothers and wives,
    It is not linen you 're wearing out,
      But human creatures' lives!
_The Song of the Shirt._
    Sewing at once a double thread,
      A shroud as well as a shirt.
_The Song of the Shirt._
    O God! that bread should be so dear,
    And flesh and blood so cheap!
_The Song of the Shirt._
    No blessed leisure for love or hope,
      But only time for grief.
_The Song of the Shirt._
    My tears must stop, for every drop
      Hinders needle and thread.
_The Song of the Shirt._
    One more unfortunate
      Weary of breath,
    Rashly importunate,
      Gone to her death.
_The Bridge of Sighs._
    Take her up tenderly,
      Lift her with care;
    Fashioned so slenderly,
      Young, and so fair!
_The Bridge of Sighs._
    Alas for the rarity
    Of Christian charity
      Under the sun!
_The Bridge of Sighs._
    Even God's providence
      Seeming estrang'd.
_The Bridge of Sighs._
    No sun, no moon, no morn, no noon,
    No dawn, no dusk, no proper time of day,
         .     .     .     .     .     .
    No road, no street, no t' other side the way,
         .     .     .     .     .     .
    No shade, no shine, no butterflies, no bees,
    No fruits, no flowers, no leaves, no buds.
_November._
    No solemn sanctimonious face I pull,
      Nor think I 'm pious when I 'm only bilious;
      Nor study in my sanctum supercilious,
    To frame a Sabbath Bill or forge a Bull.
_Ode to Rae Wilson._
    The Quaker loves an ample brim,
      A hat that bows to no salaam;
    And dear the beaver is to him
      As if it never made a dam.
_All round my Hat._
GEORGE LINLEY. 1798-1865.
    Ever of thee I 'm fondly dreaming,
    Thy gentle voice my spirit can cheer.
_Ever of Thee._
    Thou art gone from my gaze like a beautiful dream,
    And I seek thee in vain by the meadow and stream.
_Thou art gone._
    Tho' lost to sight, to mem'ry dear
      Thou ever wilt remain;
    One only hope my heart can cheer,
      The hope to meet again.
    Oh fondly on the past I dwell,
      And oft recall those hours
    When, wand'ring down the shady dell,
      We gathered the wild-flowers.
    Yes, life then seem'd one pure delight,
      Tho' now each spot looks drear;
    Yet tho' thy smile be lost to sight,
      To mem'ry thou art dear.
    Oft in the tranquil hour of night,
      When stars illume the sky,
    I gaze upon each orb of light,
      And wish that thou wert by.
    I think upon that happy time,
      That time so fondly lov'd,
    When last we heard the sweet bells chime,
      As thro' the fields we rov'd.
    Yes, life then seem'd one pure delight,
      Tho' now each spot looks drear;
    Yet tho' thy smile be lost to sight,
      To mem'ry thou art dear.
_Song._

ROBERT POLLOK. 1799-1827.
    Sorrows remember'd sweeten present joy.
_The Course of Time. Book i. Line 464._
    He laid his hand upon "the Ocean's mane,"
    And played familiar with his hoary locks.
_The Course of Time. Book iv. Line 389._
                          He was a man
    Who stole the livery of the court of Heaven
    To serve the Devil in.
_The Course of Time. Book viii. Line 616._
                  With one hand he put
    A penny in the urn of poverty,
    And with the other took a shilling out.
_The Course of Time. Book viii. Line 632._
RUFUS CHOATE. 1799-1859.
     There was a state without king or nobles; there was a church
     without a bishop;[588-3] there was a people governed by grave
     magistrates which it had selected, and by equal laws which it had
     framed.
_Speech before the New England Society, Dec. 22, 1843._
     We join ourselves to no party that does not carry the flag and
     keep step to the music of the Union.
_Letter to the Whig Convention, 1855._
     Its constitution the glittering and sounding generalities
     of natural right which make up the Declaration of Independence.
_Letter to the Maine Whig Committee, 1856._
THOMAS K. HERVEY. 1799-1859.
    The tomb of him who would have made
      The world too glad and free.
_The Devil's Progress._
    He stood beside a cottage lone
      And listened to a lute,
    One summer's eve, when the breeze was gone,
      And the nightingale was mute.
_The Devil's Progress._
    A love that took an early root,
      And had an early doom.
_The Devil's Progress._
    Like ships, that sailed for sunny isles,
      But never came to shore.
_The Devil's Progress._
    A Hebrew knelt in the dying light,
      His eye was dim and cold,
    The hairs on his brow were silver-white,
      And his blood was thin and old.
_The Devil's Progress._
THOMAS B. MACAULAY. 1800-1859.
(_From his Essays._)
     That is the best government which desires to make the people
     happy, and knows how to make them happy.
_On Mitford's History of Greece. 1824._
     Free trade, one of the greatest blessings which a government can
     confer on a people, is in almost every country unpopular.
_On Mitford's History of Greece. 1824._
     The history of nations, in the sense in which I use the word, is
     often best studied in works not professedly historical.
_On Mitford's History of Greece. 1824._
     Wherever literature consoles sorrow or assuages pain; wherever it
     brings gladness to eyes which fail with wakefulness and tears,
     and ache for the dark house and the long sleep,--there is
     exhibited in its noblest form the immortal influence of Athens.
_On Mitford's History of Greece. 1824._
     We hold that the most wonderful and splendid proof of genius is a
     great poem produced in a civilized age.
_On Milton. 1825._
     Nobles by the right of an earlier creation, and priests by the
     imposition of a mightier hand.
_On Milton. 1825._
     Out of his surname they have coined an epithet for a knave, and
     out of his Christian name a synonym for the Devil.
_On Machiavelli. 1825._
     The English Bible,--a book which if everything else in our
     language should perish, would alone suffice to show the whole
     extent of its beauty and power.
_On John Dryden. 1828._
     His imagination resembled the wings of an ostrich. It enabled him
     to run, though not to soar.
_On John Dryden. 1828._
     A man possessed of splendid talents, which he often abused, and
     of a sound judgment, the admonitions of which he often neglected;
     a man who succeeded only in an inferior department of his art,
     but who in that department succeeded pre-eminently.
_On John Dryden. 1828._
     He had a head which statuaries loved to copy, and a foot the
     deformity of which the beggars in the streets mimicked.
_On Moore's Life of Lord Byron. 1830._
     We know no spectacle so ridiculous as the British public in one
     of its periodical fits of morality.
_On Moore's Life of Lord Byron. 1830._
     From the poetry of Lord Byron they drew a system of ethics
     compounded of misanthropy and voluptuousness,--a system in which
     the two great commandments were to hate your neighbour and to
     love your neighbour's wife.
_On Moore's Life of Lord Byron. 1830._
     That wonderful book, while it obtains admiration from the most
     fastidious critics, is loved by those who are too simple to
     admire it.
_On Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. 1831._
     The conformation of his mind was such that whatever was little
     seemed to him great, and whatever was great seemed to him little.
_On Horace Walpole. 1833._
     What a singular destiny has been that of this remarkable man!--To
     be regarded in his own age as a classic, and in ours as a
     companion! To receive from his contemporaries that full homage
     which men of genius have in general received only from posterity;
     to be more intimately known to posterity than other men are known
     to their contemporaries!
_On Boswell's Life of Johnson_ (Croker's ed.). _1831._
     Temple was a man of the world amongst men of letters, a man of
     letters amongst men of the world.
_On Sir William Temple. 1838._
     She [the Roman Catholic Church] may still exist in undiminished
     vigour when some traveller from New Zealand shall, in the midst
     of a vast solitude, take his stand on a broken arch of London
     Bridge to sketch the ruins of St. Paul's.
_On Ranke's History of the Popes. 1840._
     The chief-justice was rich, quiet, and infamous.
_On Warren Hastings. 1841._
     In that temple of silence and reconciliation where the enmities
     of twenty generations lie buried, in the great Abbey which has
     during many ages afforded a quiet resting-place to those whose
     minds and bodies have been shattered by the contentions of the
     Great Hall.
_On Warren Hastings. 1841._
     In order that he might rob a neighbour whom he had promised to
     defend, black men fought on the coast of Coromandel and red men
     scalped each other by the great lakes of North America.
_On Frederic the Great. 1842._
     We hardly know an instance of the strength and weakness of human
     nature so striking and so grotesque as the character of this
     haughty, vigilant, resolute, sagacious blue-stocking, half
     Mithridates and half Trissotin, bearing up against a world in
     arms, with an ounce of poison in one pocket and a quire of bad
     verses in the other.
_On Frederic the Great. 1842._
     I shall cheerfully bear the reproach of having descended below
     the dignity of history.
_History of England. Vol. i. Chap. i._
     There were gentlemen and there were seamen in the navy of Charles
     II. But the seamen were not gentlemen, and the gentlemen were not
     seamen.
_History of England. Vol. i. Chap. ii._
     The Puritan hated bear-baiting, not because it gave pain to the
     bear, but because it gave pleasure to the spectators.
_History of England. Vol. i. Chap. iii._
     I have not the Chancellor's encyclopedic mind. He is indeed a
     kind of semi-Solomon. He _half_ knows everything, from the cedar
     to the hyssop.
_Letter to Macvey Napier, Dec. 17, 1830._
    To every man upon this earth
      Death cometh soon or late;
    And how can man die better
      Than facing fearful odds
    For the ashes of his fathers
      And the temples of his gods?
_Lays of Ancient Rome. Horatius, xxvii._
    How well Horatius kept the bridge
      In the brave days of old.

J. A. WADE. 1800-1875.
    Meet me by moonlight alone,
      And then I will tell you a tale
    Must be told by the moonlight alone,
      In the grove at the end of the vale!
_Meet me by Moonlight._
    'T were vain to tell thee all I feel,
      Or say for thee I 'd die.
_'T were vain to tell._
SIR HENRY TAYLOR. 1800-18--.
    The world knows nothing of its greatest men.
_Philip Van Artevelde. Part i. Act i. Sc. 5._
    An unreflected light did never yet
    Dazzle the vision feminine.
_Philip Van Artevelde. Part i. Act i. Sc. 5._
    He that lacks time to mourn, lacks time to mend.
    Eternity mourns that. 'T is an ill cure
    For life's worst ills, to have no time to feel them.
    Where sorrow 's held intrusive and turned out,
    There wisdom will not enter, nor true power,
    Nor aught that dignifies humanity.
_Philip Van Artevelde. Part i. Act i. Sc. 5._
                     We figure to ourselves
    The thing we like; and then we build it up,
    As chance will have it, on the rock or sand,
    For thought is tired of wandering o'er the world,
    And homebound Fancy runs her bark ashore.
_Philip Van Artevelde. Part i. Act i. Sc. 5._
                           Such souls,
    Whose sudden visitations daze the world,
    Vanish like lightning, but they leave behind
    A voice that in the distance far away
    Wakens the slumbering ages.
_Philip Van Artevelde. Part i. Act i. Sc. 7._
WILLIAM H. SEWARD. 1801-1872.
     There is a higher law than the Constitution.
_Speech, March 11, 1850._
     It is an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring
     forces.
_Speech, Oct. 25, 1858._
W. M. PRAED. 1802-1839.
    Twelve years ago I was a boy,
      A happy boy at Drury's.
_School and Schoolfellows._
    Some lie beneath the churchyard stone,
      And some before the speaker.
_School and Schoolfellows._
    I remember, I remember
      How my childhood fleeted by,
    The mirth of its December
      And the warmth of its July.
_I remember, I remember._
GEORGE P. MORRIS. 1802-1864.
    Woodman, spare that tree!
      Touch not a single bough!
    In youth it sheltered me,
      And I 'll protect it now.
_Woodman, spare that Tree! 1830._
    A song for our banner! The watchword recall
      Which gave the Republic her station:
    "United we stand, divided we fall!"
      It made and preserves us a nation!
    The union of lakes, the union of lands,
      The union of States none can sever,
    The union of hearts, the union of hands,
      And the flag of our Union forever!
_The Flag of our Union._
    Near the lake where drooped the willow,
        Long time ago!
_Near the Lake._
ALBERT G. GREENE. 1802-1868.
    Old Grimes is dead, that good old man
      We never shall see more;
    He used to wear a long black coat
      All buttoned down before.
_Old Grimes._
LYDIA MARIA CHILD. 1802-1880.
     England may as well dam up the waters of the Nile with bulrushes
     as to fetter the step of Freedom, more proud and firm in this
     youthful land than where she treads the sequestered glens of
     Scotland, or couches herself among the magnificent mountains of
     Switzerland.
_Supposititious Speech of James Otis. The Rebels, Chap. iv._
DOUGLAS JERROLD. 1803-1857.
     He is one of those wise philanthropists who in a time of famine

     and sweetened by the airs of heaven.
_The Husbandman's Life._
     Some people are so fond of ill-luck that they run half-way to
     meet it.
_Meeting Troubles Half-way._
     Earth is here so kind, that just tickle her with a hoe and she
     laughs with a harvest.
_A Land of Plenty_ [_Australia_].
     The ugliest of trades have their moments of pleasure. Now, if I
     were a grave-digger, or even a hangman, there are some people I
     could work for with a great deal of enjoyment.
_Ugly Trades._
     A blessed companion is a book,--a book that fitly chosen is a
     life-long friend.
_Books._
     There is something about a wedding-gown prettier than in any
     other gown in the world.
_A Wedding-gown._
     He was so good he would pour rose-water on a toad.
_A Charitable Man._
     As for the brandy, "nothing extenuate;" and the water, put nought
     in in malice.
_Shakespeare Grog._
     Talk to him of Jacob's ladder, and he would ask the number of the
     steps.
_A Matter-of-fact Man._
RALPH WALDO EMERSON. 1803-1882.
    Nor knowest thou what argument
    Thy life to thy neighbor's creed has lent.
    All are needed by each one;
    Nothing is fair or good alone.
_Each and All._
    I wiped away the weeds and foam,
    I fetched my sea-born treasures home;
    But the poor, unsightly, noisome things
    Had left their beauty on the shore,
    With the sun and the sand and the wild uproar.
_Each and All._
    Not from a vain or shallow thought
    His awful Jove young Phidias brought.
_The Problem._
    Out from the heart of Nature rolled
    The burdens of the Bible old.
_The Problem._
    The hand that rounded Peter's dome,
    And groined the aisles of Christian Rome,
    Wrought in a sad sincerity;
    Himself from God he could not free;
    He builded better than he knew:
    The conscious stone to beauty grew.
_The Problem._
    Earth proudly wears the Parthenon
    As the best gem upon her zone.
_The Problem._
    Earth laughs in flowers to see her boastful boys
    Earth-proud, proud of the earth which is not theirs;
    Who steer the plough, but cannot steer their feet
    Clear of the grave.
_Hamatreya._
    Good bye, proud world! I 'm going home;
    Thou art not my friend, and I 'm not thine.
_Good Bye._
    For what are they all in their high conceit,
    When man in the bush with God may meet?
_Good Bye._
                If eyes were made for seeing,
    Then Beauty is its own excuse for being.
_The Rhodora._
    Things are in the saddle,
      And ride mankind.
_Ode, inscribed to W. H. Channing._
    Olympian bards who sung
      Divine ideas below,
    Which always find us young
      And always keep us so.
_Ode to Beauty._
    Heartily know,
    When half-gods go,
    The gods arrive.
_Give all to Love._
    Love not the flower they pluck and know it not,
    And all their botany is Latin names.
_Blight._
    The silent organ loudest chants
      The master's requiem.
_Dirge._
    By the rude bridge that arched the flood,
      Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,
    Here once the embattl'd farmers stood,
      And fired the shot heard round the world.
_Hymn sung at the Completion of the Battle Monument._
    What potent blood hath modest May!
_May-Day._
    And striving to be man, the worm
      Mounts through all the spires of form.
_May-Day._
    And every man, in love or pride,
    Of his fate is never wide.
_Nemesis._
    None shall rule but the humble,
      And none but Toil shall have.
_Boston Hymn. 1863._
    Oh, tenderly the haughty day
      Fills his blue urn with fire.
_Ode, Concord, July 4, 1857._
    Go put your creed into your deed,
      Nor speak with double tongue.
_Ode, Concord, July 4, 1857._
    So nigh is grandeur to our dust,
      So near is God to man,
    When Duty whispers low, Thou must,
      The youth replies, I can!
_Voluntaries._
    Whoever fights, whoever falls,
      Justice conquers evermore.
_Voluntaries._

    Born for success he seemed,
    With grace to win, with heart to hold,
    With shining gifts that took all eyes.
_In Memoriam._

    That Genius goes and Folly stays.
_In Memoriam._
    Fear not, then, thou child infirm;
    There 's no god dare wrong a worm.
_Compensation._
    He thought it happier to be dead,
    To die for Beauty, than live for bread.
_Beauty._
    Wilt thou seal up the avenues of ill?
    Pay every debt, as if God wrote the bill?
_Suum Cuique._
    Too busy with the crowded hour to fear to live or die.
_Quatrains. Nature._
    Though love repine, and reason chafe,
      There came a voice without reply,
    "'T is man's perdition to be safe
      When for the truth he ought to die."
_Sacrifice._
    For what avail the plough or sail,
    Or land or life, if freedom fail?
_Boston._
     If the single man plant himself indomitably on his instincts, and
     there abide, the huge world will come round to him.
_Nature. Addresses and Lectures. The American Scholar._

     The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its
     aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and
     customs.
_Essays. First Series. Self-Reliance._
     A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by
     little statesmen and philosophers and divines.
_Essays. First Series. Self-Reliance._
     To be great is to be misunderstood.
_Essays. First Series. Self-Reliance._
     Discontent is the want of self-reliance: it is infirmity of will.

_Representative Men. Uses of Great Men._
     Is not marriage an open question, when it is alleged, from the
     beginning of the world, that such as are in the institution wish

_Representative Men. Montaigne._
     Thought is the property of him who can entertain it, and of him

_The Conduct of Life. Civilization._
     I rarely read any Latin, Greek, German, Italian, sometimes not a
     French book, in the original, which I can procure in a good
     version. I like to be beholden to the great metropolitan English
     speech, the sea which receives tributaries from every region
     under heaven. I should as soon think of swimming across Charles

     I do not find that the age or country makes the least difference;
     no, nor the language the actors spoke, nor the religion which
     they professed, whether Arab in the desert or Frenchman in the
     Academy. I see that sensible men and conscientious men all over
     the world were of one religion.

    Spake full well, in language quaint and olden,
      One who dwelleth by the castled Rhine,
    When he called the flowers, so blue and golden,
      Stars, that in earth's firmament do shine.

_The Goblet of Life._
    Standing with reluctant feet
    Where the brook and river meet,
    Womanhood and childhood fleet!

    The day is done, and the darkness
      Falls from the wings of Night,
    As a feather is wafted downward
      From an eagle in his flight.
_The Day is done._
    A feeling of sadness and longing
      That is not akin to pain,
    And resembles sorrow only
      As the mist resembles the rain.

    And the night shall be filled with music,
      And the cares that infest the day
    Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,

    There is no flock, however watched and tended,
      But one dead lamb is there;
    There is no fireside, howsoe'er defended,

_Resignation._
    The air is full of farewells to the dying,
      And mournings for the dead.
_Resignation._
    But oftentimes celestial benedictions
      Assume this dark disguise.
_Resignation._
    What seem to us but sad, funereal tapers
      May be heaven's distant lamps.
_Resignation._
    There is no death! What seems so is transition;
      This life of mortal breath
    Is but a suburb of the life elysian,
      Whose portal we call Death.
_Resignation._
    Safe from temptation, safe from sin's pollution,
      She lives whom we call dead.
_Resignation._
    In the elder days of Art,

    A ladder, if we will but tread
      Beneath our feet each deed of shame.
_The Ladder of Saint Augustine._
    The heights by great men reached and kept
      Were not attained by sudden flight,

    Something the heart must have to cherish,
      Must love and joy and sorrow learn;
    Something with passion clasp, or perish
      And in itself to ashes burn.
_Hyperion. Book ii._
     Alas! it is not till time, with reckless hand, has torn out half

    Of simulated stature, face, and speech:
    It also peradventure may outgrow
    The simulation of the painted scene,
    Boards, actors, prompters, gaslight, and costume,
    And take for a worthier stage the soul itself,
    Its shifting fancies and celestial lights,
    With all its grand orchestral silences
    To keep the pauses of its rhythmic sounds.
_Aurora Leigh. Book v._
ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 1809-1865.
     I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave
     and half free.
_Speech, June 16, 1858._
     Let us have faith that right makes might; and in that faith let
     us dare to do our duty as we understand it.
_Address, New York City, Feb. 21, 1859._
     In giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the
     free,--honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve.
_Second Annual Message to Congress, Dec. 1, 1862._
     That this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom,
     and that government of the people, by the people, for the people,
     shall not perish from the earth.
_Speech at Gettysburg, Nov. 19, 1863._
     With malice towards none, with charity for all, with firmness in
     the right, as God gives us to see the right.
_Second Inaugural Address, March 4, 1865._
CHARLES DARWIN. 1809-1882.
     I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if
     useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection.
_The Origin of Species. Chap. iii._
     We will now discuss in a little more detail the Struggle for
     Existence.
_The Origin of Species. Chap. iii._
     The expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival
     of the Fittest is more accurate, and is sometimes equally
     convenient.
_The Origin of Species. Chap. iii._
ALFRED TENNYSON. 1809- ----.
(_From the edition of 1884._)
    This laurel greener from the brows
    Of him that utter'd nothing base.
_To the Queen._
    And statesmen at her council met
      Who knew the seasons, when to take
      Occasion by the hand, and make
    The bounds of freedom wider yet.
_To the Queen._
    Broad based upon her people's will,
    And compassed by the inviolate sea.
_To the Queen._
    For it was in the golden prime
      Of good Haroun Alraschid.
_Recollections of the Arabian Nights._
    Dowered with the hate of hate, the scorn of scorn,
    The love of love.
_The Poet._
    Like glimpses of forgotten dreams.
_The Two Voices. Stanza cxxvii._
    Across the walnuts and the wine.
_The Miller's Daughter._
    O love! O fire! once he drew
    With one long kiss my whole soul through
    My lips, as sunlight drinketh dew.
_Fatima. Stanza 3._
    Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control,
    These three alone lead life to sovereign power.
_OEnone._
      Because right is right, to follow right
    Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence.
_OEnone._
    I built my soul a lordly pleasure-house,
      Wherein at ease for aye to dwell.
_The Palace of Art._
    Her manners had not that repose
      Which stamps the caste of Vere de Vere.
_Lady Clara Vere de Vere. Stanza 5._
      From yon blue heaven above us bent,
    The grand old gardener and his wife
      Smile at the claims of long descent.
_Lady Clara Vere de Vere. Stanza 7._
    Howe'er it be, it seems to me,
      'T is only noble to be good.
    Kind hearts are more than coronets,
      And simple faith than Norman blood.
_Lady Clara Vere de Vere. Stanza 7._
    You must wake and call me early, call me early, mother dear;
    To-morrow 'll be the happiest time of all the glad New Year,
    Of all the glad New Year, mother, the maddest, merriest day;
    For I 'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I 'm to be queen o' the May.
_The May Queen._
                     Ah, why
    Should life all labour be?
_The Lotus-Eaters. iv._
    A daughter of the gods, divinely tall,
      And most divinely fair.
_A Dream of Fair Women. Stanza xxii._
    God gives us love. Something to love
      He lends us; but when love is grown
    To ripeness, that on which it throve
      Falls off, and love is left alone.
_To J. S._
    Sleep sweetly, tender heart, in peace!
      Sleep, holy spirit, blessed soul,
    While the stars burn, the moons increase,
      And the great ages onward roll.
_To J. S._
    Sleep till the end, true soul and sweet!
      Nothing comes to thee new or strange.
    Sleep full of rest from head to feet;
      Lie still, dry dust, secure of change.
_To J. S._
    More black than ash-buds in the front of March.
_The Gardener's Daughter._
    Of love that never found his earthly close,
    What sequel? Streaming eyes and breaking hearts;
    Or all the same as if he had not been?
_Love and Duty._
    The long mechanic pacings to and fro,
    The set, gray life, and apathetic end.
_Love and Duty._
          Ah, when shall all men's good
    Be each man's rule, and universal peace
    Lie like a shaft of light across the land,
    And like a lane of beams athwart the sea,
    Thro' all the circle of the golden year?
_The Golden Year._
    I am a part of all that I have met.
_Ulysses._
    How dull it is to pause, to make an end,
    To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use,
    As tho' to breathe were life!
_Ulysses._
    It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
    And see the great Achilles whom we knew.
_Ulysses._
    Here at the quiet limit of the world.
_Tithonus._
    In the spring a livelier iris changes on the burnish'd dove;
    In the spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.
_Locksley Hall. Line 19._
    Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with might;
    Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass'd in music out of sight.
_Locksley Hall. Line 33._
    He will hold thee, when his passion shall have spent its novel force,
    Something better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse.
_Locksley Hall. Line 49._
                 This is truth the poet sings,
    That a sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.
_Locksley Hall. Line 75._
    Like a dog, he hunts in dreams.
_Locksley Hall. Line 79._
    With a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter's heart.
_Locksley Hall. Line 94._
    But the jingling of the guinea helps the hurt that Honour feels.
_Locksley Hall. Line 105._
    Men, my brothers, men the workers, ever reaping something new.
_Locksley Hall. Line 117._
    Yet I doubt not through the ages one increasing purpose runs,
    And the thoughts of men are widen'd with the process of the suns.
_Locksley Hall. Line 137._
    Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers.
_Locksley Hall. Line 141._
    I will take some savage woman, she shall rear my dusky race.
_Locksley Hall. Line 168._
    I, the heir of all the ages, in the foremost files of time.
_Locksley Hall. Line 178._
    Let the great world spin forever down the ringing grooves of change.
_Locksley Hall. Line 182._
    Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay.
_Locksley Hall. Line 184._
    I waited for the train at Coventry;
    I hung with grooms and porters on the bridge,
    To watch the three tall spires; and there I shaped
    The city's ancient legend into this.
_Godiva._
    And on her lover's arm she leant,
      And round her waist she felt it fold,
    And far across the hills they went
      In that new world which is the old.
_The Day-Dream. The Departure, i._
    And o'er the hills, and far away
      Beyond their utmost purple rim,
    Beyond the night, across the day,
      Thro' all the world she follow'd him.
_The Day-Dream. The Departure, iv._
    We are ancients of the earth,
    And in the morning of the times.
_L'Envoi._
    As she fled fast through sun and shade
    The happy winds upon her play'd,
    Blowing the ringlet from the braid.
_Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere._
    For now the poet cannot die,
      Nor leave his music as of old,
      But round him ere he scarce be cold
    Begins the scandal and the cry.
_To ----, after reading a Life and Letters._
    But oh for the touch of a vanish'd hand,
      And the sound of a voice that is still!
_Break, break, break._
    But the tender grace of a day that is dead
      Will never come back to me.
_Break, break, break._
    For men may come and men may go,
      But I go on forever.
_The Brook._
    Mastering the lawless science of our law,
    That codeless myriad of precedent,
    That wilderness of single instances.
_Aylmer's Field._
    Rich in saving common-sense,
    And, as the greatest only are,
    In his simplicity sublime.
_Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington. Stanza 4._
    Oh good gray head which all men knew!
_Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington. Stanza 4._
                    That tower of strength
    Which stood four-square to all the winds that blew.
_Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington. Stanza 4._
    For this is England's greatest son,
    He that gain'd a hundred fights,
    And never lost an English gun.
_Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington. Stanza 6._
    Not once or twice in our rough-island story
    The path of duty was the way to glory.
_Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington. Stanza 8._
    All in the valley of death
      Rode the six hundred.
_The Charge of the Light Brigade. Stanza 1._
      Some one had blunder'd:
    Theirs not to make reply,
    Theirs not to reason why,
    Theirs but to do and die.
_The Charge of the Light Brigade. Stanza 2._
    Cannon to right of them,
    Cannon to left of them,
    Cannon in front of them.
         .     .     .     .
    Into the jaws of death,
    Into the mouth of hell
      Rode the six hundred.
_The Charge of the Light Brigade. Stanza 3._
    That a lie which is half a truth is ever the blackest of lies;
    That a lie which is all a lie may be met and fought with outright;
    But a lie which is part a truth is a harder matter to fight.
_The Grandmother. Stanza 8._
    O Love! what hours were thine and mine,
    In lands of palm and southern pine;
      In lands of palm, of orange-blossom,
    Of olive, aloe, and maize and vine!
_The Daisy. Stanza 1._
    So dear a life your arms enfold,
    Whose crying is a cry for gold.
_The Daisy. Stanza 24._
    Read my little fable:
      He that runs may read.
    Most can raise the flowers now,
      For all have got the seed.
_The Flower._
    In that fierce light which beats upon a throne.
_Idylls of the King. Dedication._
    It is the little rift within the lute
    That by and by will make the music mute,
    And ever widening slowly silence all.
_Idylls of the King. Merlin and Vivien._
    His honour rooted in dishonour stood,
    And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true.
_Idylls of the King. Launcelot and Elaine._
    The old order changeth, yielding place to new;
    And God fulfils himself in many ways,
    Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.
_The Passing of Arthur._
                   I am going a long way
    With these thou seëst--if indeed I go
    (For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)
    To the island-valley of Avilion,
    Where falls not hail or rain or any snow,
    Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies
    Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard lawns
    And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea,
    Where I will heal me of my grievous wound.
_The Passing of Arthur._
    With prudes for proctors, dowagers for deans,
    And sweet girl-graduates in their golden hair.
_The Princess. Prologue. Line 141._
    A rosebud set with little wilful thorns,
    And sweet as English air could make her, she.
_The Princess. Part i. Line 153._
                        Jewels five-words-long,
    That on the stretch'd forefinger of all Time
    Sparkle forever.
_The Princess. Part ii. Line 355._
    Blow, bugle, blow! set the wild echoes flying!
    Blow, bugle! answer, echoes! dying, dying, dying.
_The Princess. Part iii. Line 352._
          O Love! they die in yon rich sky,
            They faint on hill or field or river:
          Our echoes roll from soul to soul,
            And grow forever and forever.
    Blow, bugle, blow! set the wild echoes flying!
    And answer, echoes, answer! dying, dying, dying.
_The Princess. Part iii. Line 360._
    There sinks the nebulous star we call the sun.
_The Princess. Part iv. Line 1._
      Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean.
    Tears from the depth of some divine despair
    Rise in the heart and gather to the eyes,
    In looking on the happy autumn-fields,
    And thinking of the days that are no more.
_The Princess. Part iv. Line 21._
                Unto dying eyes
    The casement slowly grows a glimmering square.
_The Princess. Part iv. Line 33._
      Dear as remember'd kisses after death,
    And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign'd
    On lips that are for others; deep as love,
    Deep as first love, and wild with all regret.
    Oh death in life, the days that are no more!
_The Princess. Part iv. Line 36._
                 Sweet is every sound,
    Sweeter thy voice, but every sound is sweet;
    Myriads of rivulets hurrying thro' the lawn,
    The moan of doves in immemorial elms,
    And murmuring of innumerable bees.
_The Princess. Part vii. Line 203._
                      Happy he
    With such a mother! faith in womankind
    Beats with his blood, and trust in all things high
    Comes easy to him; and tho' he trip and fall,
    He shall not blind his soul with clay.
_The Princess. Part vii. Line 308._
    Faultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly null.
_Maud. Part i. ii._
    That jewell'd mass of millinery,
    That oil'd and curl'd Assyrian Bull.
_Maud. Part i. vi. Stanza 6._
    Gorgonized me from head to foot,
      With a stony British stare.
_Maud. Part i. xiii. Stanza 2._
    Come into the garden, Maud,
      For the black bat, night, has flown;
    Come into the garden, Maud,
      I am here at the gate alone.
_Maud. Part i. xxii. Stanza 1._
    Queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls.
_Maud. Part i. xxii. Stanza 9._
    Ah, Christ, that it were possible
      For one short hour to see
    The souls we loved, that they might tell us
      What and where they be.
_Maud. Part ii. iv. Stanza 3._
    Let knowledge grow from more to more.
_In Memoriam. Prologue. Line 25._
    I held it truth, with him who sings
      To one clear harp in divers tones,
      That men may rise on stepping-stones
    Of their dead selves to higher things.
_In Memoriam. i. Stanza 1._
    But for the unquiet heart and brain
      A use in measured language lies;
      The sad mechanic exercise
    Like dull narcotics numbing pain.
_In Memoriam. v. Stanza 2._
                 Never morning wore
    To evening, but some heart did break.
_In Memoriam. vi. Stanza 2._
      And topples round the dreary west
    A looming bastion fringed with fire.
_In Memoriam. xv. Stanza 5._
      And from his ashes may be made
    The violet of his native land.
_In Memoriam. xviii. Stanza 1._
      I do but sing because I must,
    And pipe but as the linnets sing.
_In Memoriam. xxi. Stanza 6._
    The shadow cloak'd from head to foot.
_In Memoriam. xxiii. Stanza 1._
    Who keeps the keys of all the creeds.
_In Memoriam. xxiii. Stanza 2._
      And Thought leapt out to wed with Thought
    Ere Thought could wed itself with Speech.
_In Memoriam. xxiii. Stanza 4._
      'T is better to have loved and lost
    Than never to have loved at all.
_In Memoriam. xxvii. Stanza 4._
    Her eyes are homes of silent prayer.
_In Memoriam. xxxii. Stanza 1._
      Whose faith has centre everywhere,
    Nor cares to fix itself to form.
_In Memoriam. xxxiii. Stanza 1._
      Short swallow-flights of song, that dip
    Their wings in tears, and skim away.
_In Memoriam. xlviii. Stanza 4._
    Hold thou the good; define it well;
      For fear divine Philosophy
      Should push beyond her mark, and be
    Procuress to the Lords of Hell.
_In Memoriam. liii. Stanza 4._
    Oh yet we trust that somehow good
      Will be the final goal of ill.
_In Memoriam. liv. Stanza 1._
                 But what am I?
      An infant crying in the night:
      An infant crying for the light,
    And with no language but a cry.
_In Memoriam. liv. Stanza 5._
      So careful of the type she seems,
    So careless of the single life.
_In Memoriam. lv. Stanza 2._
               The great world's altar-stairs,
    That slope through darkness up to God.
_In Memoriam. lv. Stanza 4._
    Who battled for the True, the Just.
_In Memoriam. lvi. Stanza 5._
    And grasps the skirts of happy chance,
    And breasts the blows of circumstance.
_In Memoriam. lxiv. Stanza 2._
      And lives to clutch the golden keys,
      To mould a mighty state's decrees,
    And shape the whisper of the throne.
_In Memoriam. lxiv. Stanza 3._
    So many worlds, so much to do,
      So little done, such things to be.
_In Memoriam. lxxiii. Stanza 1._
    Thy leaf has perish'd in the green,
      And while we breathe beneath the sun,
      The world, which credits what is done,
    Is cold to all that might have been.
_In Memoriam. lxxv. Stanza 4._
    O last regret, regret can die!
_In Memoriam. lxxviii. Stanza 5._
      There lives more faith in honest doubt,
    Believe me, than in half the creeds.
_In Memoriam. xcvi. Stanza 3._
    He seems so near, and yet so far.
_In Memoriam. xcvii. Stanza 6._
    Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky!
_In Memoriam. cv. Stanza 1._
    Ring out the old, ring in the new,
    Ring, happy bells, across the snow!
_In Memoriam. cv. Stanza 2._
      Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,
    But ring the fuller minstrel in!
_In Memoriam. cv. Stanza 5._
    Ring out old shapes of foul disease,
      Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;
      Ring out the thousand wars of old,
    Ring in the thousand years of peace!
_In Memoriam. cv. Stanza 7._
    Ring in the valiant man and free,
      The larger heart, the kindlier hand!
      Ring out the darkness of the land,
    Ring in the Christ that is to be!
_In Memoriam. cv. Stanza 8._
    And thus he bore without abuse
      The grand old name of gentleman,
      Defamed by every charlatan,
    And soil'd with all ignoble use.
_In Memoriam. cxi. Stanza 6._
              Some novel power
      Sprang up forever at a touch,
      And hope could never hope too much
    In watching thee from hour to hour.
_In Memoriam. cxii. Stanza 3._
    Large elements in order brought,
      And tracts of calm from tempest made,
      And world-wide fluctuation sway'd,
    In vassal tides that follow'd thought.
_In Memoriam. cxii. Stanza 4._
           Wearing all that weight
    Of learning lightly like a flower.
_In Memoriam. Conclusion. Stanza 10._
      One God, one law, one element,
      And one far-off divine event
    To which the whole creation moves.
_In Memoriam. Conclusion. Stanza 36._
RICHARD MONCKTON MILNES (LORD HOUGHTON). 1809-1885.
    But on and up, where Nature's heart
      Beats strong amid the hills.
_Tragedy of the Lac de Gaube. Stanza 2._
    Great thoughts, great feelings came to them,
      Like instincts, unawares.
_The Men of Old._
    A man's best things are nearest him,
      Lie close about his feet.
_The Men of Old._
    I wandered by the brookside,
      I wandered by the mill;
    I could not hear the brook flow,
      The noisy wheel was still.
_The Brookside._
    The beating of my own heart
      Was all the sound I heard.
_The Brookside._
OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES. 1809- ----.
    Ay, tear her tattered ensign down!
      Long has it waved on high,
    And many an eye has danced to see
      That banner in the sky.
_Old Ironsides._
    Nail to the mast her holy flag,
      Set every threadbare sail,
    And give her to the god of storms,
      The lightning and the gale!
_Old Ironsides._
    Like sentinel and nun, they keep
      Their vigil on the green.
_The Cambridge Churchyard._
    The mossy marbles rest
    On the lips that he has prest
        In their bloom;
    And the names he loved to hear
    Have been carved for many a year
        On the tomb.
_The Last Leaf._
    I know it is a sin
    For me to sit and grin
        At him here;
    But the old three-cornered hat,
    And the breeches, and all that,
        Are so queer!
_The Last Leaf._
    Thou say'st an undisputed thing
      In such a solemn way.
_To an Insect._
    Their discords sting through Burns and Moore,
      Like hedgehogs dressed in lace.
_The Music-Grinders._
    You think they are crusaders sent
      From some infernal clime,
    To pluck the eyes of sentiment
      And dock the tail of Rhyme,
    To crack the voice of Melody
      And break the legs of Time.
_The Music-Grinders._
    And since, I never dare to write
      As funny as I can.
_The Height of the Ridiculous._
    When the last reader reads no more.
_The Last Reader._
    The freeman casting with unpurchased hand
    The vote that shakes the turrets of the land.
_Poetry, a Metrical Essay._
    'T is the heart's current lends the cup its glow,
    Whate'er the fountain whence the draught may flow.
_A Sentiment._
    Yes, child of suffering, thou mayst well be sure
    He who ordained the Sabbath loves the poor!
_A Rhymed Lesson. Urania._
    And when you stick on conversation's burrs,
    Don't strew your pathway with those dreadful _urs_.
_A Rhymed Lesson. Urania._
    Thine eye was on the censer,
      And not the hand that bore it.
_Lines by a Clerk._
    Where go the poet's lines?
      Answer, ye evening tapers!
    Ye auburn locks, ye golden curls,
      Speak from your folded papers!
_The Poet's Lot._
    A few can touch the magic string,
      And noisy Fame is proud to win them;
    Alas for those that never sing,
      But die with all their music in them!
_The Voiceless._
    O hearts that break and give no sign
      Save whitening lip and fading tresses!
_The Voiceless._
    Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,
    As the swift seasons roll!
    Leave thy low-vaulted past!
    Let each new temple, nobler than the last,
    Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,
    Till thou at length art free,
    Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea!
_The Chambered Nautilus._
    His home! the Western giant smiles,
      And twirls the spotty globe to find it;
    This little speck, the British Isles?
      'T is but a freckle,--never mind it.
_A Good Time going._
    But Memory blushes at the sneer,
      And Honor turns with frown defiant,
    And Freedom, leaning on her spear,
      Laughs louder than the laughing giant.
_A Good Time going._
    You hear that boy laughing?--you think he 's all fun;
    But the angels laugh, too, at the good he has done;
    The children laugh loud as they troop to his call,
    And the poor man that knows him laughs loudest of all.
_The Boys._
    Good to the heels the well-worn slipper feels
      When the tired player shuffles off the buskin;
    A page of Hood may do a fellow good
      After a scolding from Carlyle or Ruskin.
_How not to settle it._
     A thought is often original, though you have uttered it a hundred
     times.
_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. i._
     People that make puns are like wanton boys that put coppers on
     the railroad tracks.
_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. i._
     Everybody likes and respects self-made men. It is a great deal
     better to be made in that way than not to be made at all.
_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. i._
     Sin has many tools, but a lie is the handle which fits them all.
_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. vi._
     There is that glorious epicurean paradox uttered by my friend the
     historian,[637-1] in one of his flashing moments: "Give us the
     luxuries of life, and we will dispense with its necessaries." To
     this must certainly be added that other saying of one of the
     wittiest of men:[638-1] "Good Americans when they die go to
     Paris."
_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. vi._
     Boston State-house is the hub of the solar system. You could n't
     pry that out of a Boston man if you had the tire of all creation
     straightened out for a crow-bar.
_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. vi._
     The axis of the earth sticks out visibly through the centre of
     each and every town or city.
_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. vi._
     The world's great men have not commonly been great scholars, nor
     its great scholars great men.
_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. vi._
     Knowledge and timber should n't be much used till they are
     seasoned.
_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. vi._
     The hat is the _ultimum moriens_ of respectability.
_The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table. viii._
     To be seventy years young is sometimes far more cheerful and
     hopeful than to be forty years old.
_On the Seventieth Birthday of Julia Ward Howe_ (_May 27, 1889_).
ROBERT C. WINTHROP. 1809- ----.
     Our Country,--whether bounded by the St. John's and the Sabine,
     or however otherwise bounded or described, and be the
     measurements more or less,--still our Country, to be cherished in
     all our hearts, to be defended by all our hands.
_Toast at Faneuil Hall on the Fourth of July, 1845._
     A star for every State, and a State for every star.
_Address on Boston Common in 1862._
     There are no points of the compass on the chart of true
     patriotism.
_Letter to Boston Commercial Club in 1879._
     The poor must be wisely visited and liberally cared for, so that
     mendicity shall not be tempted into mendacity, nor want
     exasperated into crime.
_Yorktown Oration in 1881._
     Slavery is but half abolished, emancipation is but half
     completed, while millions of freemen with votes in their hands
     are left without education. Justice to them, the welfare of the
     States in which they live, the safety of the whole Republic, the
     dignity of the elective franchise,--all alike demand that the
     still remaining bonds of ignorance shall be unloosed and broken,
     and the minds as well as the bodies of the emancipated go free.
_Yorktown Oration in 1881._
JAMES ALDRICH. 1810-1856.
    Her suffering ended with the day,
      Yet lived she at its close,
    And breathed the long, long night away
      In statue-like repose.
_A Death-Bed._
    But when the sun in all his state
      Illumed the eastern skies,
    She passed through Glory's morning-gate,
      And walked in Paradise.
_A Death-Bed._
THEODORE PARKER. 1810-1860.
     There is what I call the American idea. . . . This idea demands,
     as the proximate organization thereof, a democracy,--that is, a
     government of all the people, by all the people, for all the
     people; of course, a government of the principles of eternal
     justice, the unchanging law of God. For shortness' sake I will
     call it the idea of Freedom.
_Speech at the N. E. Antislavery Convention, Boston, May 29, 1850._
EDMUND H. SEARS. 1810-1876.
    Calm on the listening ear of night
      Come Heaven's melodious strains,
    Where wild Judea stretches far
      Her silver-mantled plains.
_Christmas Song._
    It came upon the midnight clear,
      That glorious song of old.
_The Angels' Song._
MARTIN F. TUPPER. 1810-1889.
     A babe in a house is a well-spring of pleasure.
_Of Education._
     God, from a beautiful necessity, is Love.
_Of Immortality._
EDGAR A. POE. 1811-1849.
    Perched upon a bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door,
      Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
_The Raven._
                  Whom unmerciful disaster
    Followed fast and followed faster.
_The Raven._
    Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!
      Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
_The Raven._
    And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
      Shall be lifted--Nevermore!
_The Raven._
    To the glory that was Greece
    And the grandeur that was Rome.
_To Helen._
WENDELL PHILLIPS. 1811-1884.
     Revolutions are not made; they come.
_Speech, Jan. 28, 1852._
     What the Puritans gave the world was not thought, but action.
_Speech, Dec. 21, 1855._
     One on God's side is a majority.
_Speech, Nov. 1, 1859._
     Every man meets his Waterloo at last.
_Speech, Nov. 1, 1859._
     Revolutions never go backward.
_Speech, Feb. 12, 1861._
FRANCES ANNE KEMBLE. 1811- ----.
    A sacred burden is this life ye bear:
    Look on it, lift it, bear it solemnly,
    Stand up and walk beneath it steadfastly.
    Fail not for sorrow, falter not for sin,
    But onward, upward, till the goal ye win.
_Lines addressed to the Young Gentlemen leaving the Lenox Academy, Mass._
    Better trust all, and be deceived,
      And weep that trust and that deceiving,
    Than doubt one heart, that if believed
      Had blessed one's life with true believing.
_Faith._
BARTHOLOMEW DOWLING.
    Ho! stand to your glasses steady!
      'T is all we have left to prize.
    A cup to the dead already,
      Hurrah for the next that dies!
_Revelry in India._
ALFRED DOMETT. 1811- ----.
    It was the calm and silent night!
      Seven hundred years and fifty-three
    Had Rome been growing up to might,
      And now was queen of land and sea.
    No sound was heard of clashing wars,
      Peace brooded o'er the hushed domain;
    Apollo, Pallas, Jove, and Mars
      Held undisturbed their ancient reign
          In the solemn midnight,
              Centuries ago.
_Christmas Hymn._
JULIA A. FLETCHER (NOW MRS. CARNEY).
    Little drops of water, little grains of sand,
    Make the mighty ocean and the pleasant land.
    So the little minutes, humble though they be,
    Make the mighty ages of eternity.
_Little Things, 1845._
    Little deeds of kindness, little words of love,
    Help to make earth happy like the heaven above.
_Little Things, 1845._
AUSTEN H. LAYARD. ---- -1894.
     I have always believed that success would be the inevitable
     result if the two services, the army and the navy, had fair play,
     and if we sent the right man to fill the right place.
_Speech in Parliament, Jan. 15, 1855._
ROBERT BROWNING. 1812-1890.
                        Any nose
    May ravage with impunity a rose.
_Sordello. Book vi._
    That we devote ourselves to God, is seen
    In living just as though no God there were.
_Paracelsus. Part i._
                              Be sure that God
    Ne'er dooms to waste the strength he deigns impart.
_Paracelsus. Part i._
    I see my way as birds their trackless way.
    I shall arrive,--what time, what circuit first,
    I ask not; but unless God send his hail
    Or blinding fire-balls, sleet or stifling snow,
    In some time, his good time, I shall arrive:
    He guides me and the bird. In his good time.
_Paracelsus. Part i._
                 Are there not, dear Michal,
    Two points in the adventure of the diver,
    One, when a beggar he prepares to plunge;
    One, when a prince he rises with his pearl?
    Festus, I plunge.
_Paracelsus. Part i._
                     God is the perfect poet,
    Who in his person acts his own creations.
_Paracelsus. Part ii._
    The sad rhyme of the men who proudly clung
    To their first fault, and withered in their pride.
_Paracelsus. Part iv._
    I give the fight up: let there be an end,
    A privacy, an obscure nook for me.
    I want to be forgotten even by God.
_Paracelsus. Part v._
                              Progress is
    The law of life: man is not Man as yet.
_Paracelsus. Part v._
    Say not "a small event!" Why "small"?
    Costs it more pain that this ye call
    A "great event" should come to pass
    From that? Untwine me from the mass
    Of deeds which make up life, one deed
    Power shall fall short in or exceed!
_Pippa Passes. Introduction._
    God 's in his heaven:
    All 's right with the world.
_Pippa Passes. Part i._
    Some unsuspected isle in the far seas,
    Some unsuspected isle in far-off seas.
_Pippa Passes. Part ii._
    In the morning of the world,
    When earth was nigher heaven than now.
_Pippa Passes. Part iii._
    All service ranks the same with God,
    With God, whose puppets, best and worst,
    Are we: there is no last nor first.
_Pippa Passes. Part iv._
    I trust in Nature for the stable laws
    Of beauty and utility. Spring shall plant
    And Autumn garner to the end of time.
    I trust in God,--the right shall be the right
    And other than the wrong, while he endures.
    I trust in my own soul, that can perceive
    The outward and the inward,--Nature's good
    And God's.
_A Soul's Tragedy. Act i._
     Ever judge of men by their professions. For though the bright
     moment of promising is but a moment, and cannot be prolonged, yet
     if sincere in its moment's extravagant goodness, why, trust it,
     and know the man by it, I say,--not by his performance; which is
     half the world's work, interfere as the world needs must with its
     accidents and circumstances: the profession was purely the man's
     own. I judge people by what they might be,--not are, nor will be.
_A Soul's Tragedy. Act ii._
    There 's a woman like a dewdrop, she 's so purer than the purest.
_A Blot in the 'Scutcheon. Act i. Sc. iii._
    When is man strong until he feels alone?
_Colombe's Birthday. Act iii._
      When the fight begins within himself,
    A man 's worth something.
_Men and Women. Bishop Blougram's Apology._
                        The sprinkled isles,
    Lily on lily, that o'erlace the sea.
_Cleon._
    And I have written three books on the soul,
    Proving absurd all written hitherto,
    And putting us to ignorance again.
_Cleon._
    Sappho survives, because we sing her songs;
    And Æschylus, because we read his plays!
_Cleon._
    Rafael made a century of sonnets.
_One Word More. ii._
    Other heights in other lives, God willing.
_One Word More. xii._
    God be thanked, the meanest of his creatures
    Boasts two soul-sides,--one to face the world with,
    One to show a woman when he loves her!
_One Word More. xvii._
    Oh their Rafael of the dear Madonnas,
    Oh their Dante of the dread Inferno,
    Wrote one song--and in my brain I sing it;
    Drew one angel--borne, see, on my bosom!
_One Word More. xix._
                       The lie was dead
    And damned, and truth stood up instead.
_Count Gismond. xiii._
    Over my head his arm he flung
    Against the world.
_Count Gismond. xix._
      Just my vengeance complete,
      The man sprang to his feet,
    Stood erect, caught at God's skirts, and prayed!
    So, I was afraid!
_Instans Tyrannus. vii._
                   Oh never star
    Was lost here but it rose afar.
_Waring. ii._
    Sing, riding 's a joy! For me I ride.
_The last Ride together. vii._
    When the liquor 's out, why clink the cannikin?
_The Flight of the Duchess. xvi._
    That low man seeks a little thing to do,
        Sees it and does it;
    This high man, with a great thing to pursue,
        Dies ere he knows it.
    That low man goes on adding one to one,
        His hundred 's soon hit;
    This high man, aiming at a million,
        Misses an unit.
    That has the world here--should he need the next,
        Let the world mind him!
    This throws himself on God, and unperplexed
        Seeking shall find him.
_A Grammarian's Funeral._
    Lofty designs must close in like effects.
_A Grammarian's Funeral._
    I hear you reproach, "But delay was best,
    For their end was a crime." Oh, a crime will do
    As well, I reply, to serve for a test
    As a virtue golden through and through,
    Sufficient to vindicate itself
    And prove its worth at a moment's view!
         .     .     .     .     .     .
    Let a man contend to the uttermost
    For his life's set prize, be it what it will!
    The counter our lovers staked was lost
    As surely as if it were lawful coin;
    And the sin I impute to each frustrate ghost
    Is--the unlit lamp and the ungirt loin,
    Though the end in sight was a vice, I say.
_The Statue and the Bust._
    Lost, lost! one moment knelled the woe of years.
_Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came. xxxiii._
    Just for a handful of silver he left us,
      Just for a riband to stick in his coat.
_The Lost Leader. i._
    We shall march prospering,--not thro' his presence;
      Songs may inspirit us,--not from his lyre;
    Deeds will be done,--while he boasts his quiescence,
      Still bidding crouch whom the rest bade aspire.
_The Lost Leader. ii._
    They are perfect; how else?--they shall never change:
      We are faulty; why not?--we have time in store.
_Old Pictures in Florence. xvi._
               What 's come to perfection perishes.
    Things learned on earth we shall practise in heaven;
      Works done least rapidly Art most cherishes.
_Old Pictures in Florence. xvii._
    Italy, my Italy!
    Queen Mary's saying serves for me
      (When fortune's malice
      Lost her Calais):
    "Open my heart, and you will see
    Graved inside of it 'Italy.'"
_De Gustibus. ii._
    That 's the wise thrush; he sings each song twice over,
    Lest you should think he never could recapture
    The first fine careless rapture.
_Home-Thoughts from Abroad. ii._
    God made all the creatures, and gave them our love and our fear,
    To give sign we and they are his children, one family here.
_Saul. vi._
    How good is man's life, the mere living! how fit to employ
    All the heart and the soul and the senses forever in joy!
_Saul. ix._
    'T is not what man does which exalts him, but what man would do.
_Saul. xvii._
    O woman-country![647-1] wooed not wed,
      Loved all the more by earth's male-lands,
    Laid to their hearts instead.
_By the Fireside. vi._
                      That great brow
    And the spirit-small hand propping it.
_By the Fireside. xxiii._
    If two lives join, there is oft a scar.
      They are one and one, with a shadowy third;
    One near one is too far.
_By the Fireside. xlvi._
                     Only I discern
    Infinite passion, and the pain
    Of finite hearts that yearn.
_Two in the Campagna. xii._
    Round and round, like a dance of snow
    In a dazzling drift, as its guardians, go
    Floating the women faded for ages,
    Sculptured in stone on the poet's pages.
_Women and Roses._
    How he lies in his rights of a man!
    Death has done all death can.
    And absorbed in the new life he leads,
    He recks not, he heeds
    Nor his wrong nor my vengeance; both strike
    On his senses alike,
    And are lost in the solemn and strange
    Surprise of the change.
_After._
    Ah, did you once see Shelley plain,
      And did he stop and speak to you,
    And did you speak to him again?
      How strange it seems, and new!
_Memorabilia. i._
    He who did well in war just earns the right
    To begin doing well in peace.
_Luria. Act ii._
    And inasmuch as feeling, the East's gift,
    Is quick and transient,--comes, and lo! is gone,
    While Northern thought is slow and durable.
_Luria. Act v._
    A people is but the attempt of many
    To rise to the completer life of one;
    And those who live as models for the mass
    Are singly of more value than they all.
_Luria. Act v._
               I count life just a stuff
    To try the soul's strength on.
_In a Balcony._
    Was there nought better than to enjoy?
      No feat which, done, would make time break,
      And let us pent-up creatures through
      Into eternity, our due?
    No forcing earth teach heaven's employ?
_Dîs Aliter Visum; or, Le Byron de nos Jours._
    There shall never be one lost good! What was, shall live as before;
      The evil is null, is nought, is silence implying sound;
    What was good shall be good, with for evil so much good more;
      On the earth the broken arcs; in the heaven, a perfect round.
_Abt Vogler. ix._
             Then welcome each rebuff
             That turns earth's smoothness rough,
    Each sting that bids nor sit nor stand, but go!
             Be our joys three-parts pain!
             Strive, and hold cheap the strain;
    Learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe!
_Rabbi Ben Ezra._
    What I aspired to be,
    And was not, comforts me.
_Rabbi Ben Ezra._
    Earth changes, but thy soul and God stand sure.
_Rabbi Ben Ezra._
    For life, with all it yields of joy and woe,
    And hope and fear (believe the aged friend),
    Is just our chance o' the prize of learning love,
    How love might be, hath been indeed, and is.
_A Death in the Desert._
                             The body sprang
    At once to the height, and stayed; but the soul,--no!
_A Death in the Desert._
    What? Was man made a wheel-work to wind up,
    And be discharged, and straight wound up anew?
    No! grown, his growth lasts; taught, he ne'er forgets:
    May learn a thousand things, not twice the same.
_A Death in the Desert._
    For I say this is death and the sole death,
    When a man's loss comes to him from his gain,
    Darkness from light, from knowledge ignorance,
    And lack of love from love made manifest.
_A Death in the Desert._
    Progress, man's distinctive mark alone,
    Not God's, and not the beasts: God is, they are;
    Man partly is, and wholly hopes to be.
_A Death in the Desert._
                          The ultimate, angels' law,
    Indulging every instinct of the soul
    There where law, life, joy, impulse are one thing!
_A Death in the Desert._
    How sad and bad and mad it was!
      But then, how it was sweet!
_Confessions. ix._
    So may a glory from defect arise.
_Deaf and Dumb._
    This could but have happened once,
      And we missed it, lost it forever.
_Youth and Art. xvii._
    Fear death?--to feel the fog in my throat,
                The mist in my face.
          .      .      .      .      .      .      .
    No! let me taste the whole of it, fare like my peers,
                The heroes of old;
    Bear the brunt, in a minute pay glad life's arrears
                Of pain, darkness, and cold.
_Prospice._
    It 's wiser being good than bad;
      It 's safer being meek than fierce;
    It 's fitter being sane than mad.
      My own hope is, a sun will pierce
    The thickest cloud earth ever stretched;
      That after Last returns the First,
    Though a wide compass round be fetched;
      That what began best can't end worst,
      Nor what God blessed once prove accurst.
_Apparent Failure. vii._
    In the great right of an excessive wrong.
_The Ring and the Book. The other Half-Rome. Line 1055._
                   Was never evening yet
    But seemed far beautifuller than its day.
_The Ring and the Book. Pompilia. Line 357._
                  The curious crime, the fine
    Felicity and flower of wickedness.
_The Ring and the Book. The Pope. Line 590._
                 Of what I call God,
    And fools call Nature.
_The Ring and the Book. The Pope. Line 1073._
    Why comes temptation, but for man to meet
    And master and make crouch beneath his foot,
    And so be pedestaled in triumph?
_The Ring and the Book. The Pope. Line 1185._
    White shall not neutralize the black, nor good
    Compensate bad in man, absolve him so:
    Life's business being just the terrible choice.
_The Ring and the Book. The Pope. Line 1236._
          It is the glory and good of Art
    That Art remains the one way possible
    Of speaking truth,--to mouths like mine, at least.
_The Book and the Ring. The Pope. Line 842._
    Thy[651-1] rare gold ring of verse (the poet praised)
    Linking our England to his Italy.
_The Ring and the Book. The Pope. Line 873._
    But how carve way i' the life that lies before,
    If bent on groaning ever for the past?
_Balaustion's Adventure._
    Better have failed in the high aim, as I,
    Than vulgarly in the low aim succeed,
    As, God be thanked! I do not.
_The Inn Album. iv._
    Have you found your life distasteful?
      My life did, and does, smack sweet.
    Was your youth of pleasure wasteful?
      Mine I saved and hold complete.
    Do your joys with age diminish?
      When mine fail me, I 'll complain.
    Must in death your daylight finish?
      My sun sets to rise again.
_At the "Mermaid." Stanza 10._
                     "With this same key
    Shakespeare unlocked his heart"[652-1] once more!
    Did Shakespeare? If so, the less Shakespeare he!
_House. x._
    God's justice, tardy though it prove perchance,
    Rests never on the track until it reach
    Delinquency.

    Oh, a dainty plant is the ivy green,
      That creepeth o'er ruins old!
    Of right choice food are his meals, I ween,
      In his cell so lone and cold.
    Creeping where no life is seen,
      A rare old plant is the ivy green.
_Pickwick Papers. Chap. vi._

_Christmas Carol. Stave 2._
CHRISTOPHER P. CRANCH. 1813- ----.
    Thought is deeper than all speech,
      Feeling deeper than all thought;
    Souls to souls can never teach
      What unto themselves was taught.
_Stanzas._
    We are spirits clad in veils;
      Man by man was never seen;
    All our deep communing fails
      To remove the shadowy screen.
_Stanzas._
F. W. FABER. 1814-1863.
    For right is right, since God is God,
      And right the day must win;
    To doubt would be disloyalty,
      To falter would be sin.
_The Right must win._
    Labour itself is but a sorrowful song,
    The protest of the weak against the strong.
_The Sorrowful World._
CHARLES MACKAY. 1814- ----.
    Cleon hath a million acres,--ne'er a one have I;
    Cleon dwelleth in a palace,--in a cottage I.
_Cleon and I._
    But the sunshine aye shall light the sky,
      As round and round we run;
    And the truth shall ever come uppermost,
      And justice shall be done.
_Eternal Justice. Stanza 4._
    Aid the dawning, tongue and pen;
    Aid it, hopes of honest men!

    There 's a good time coming, boys!
      A good time coming.
_The Good Time coming._
    Old Tubal Cain was a man of might
    In the days when earth was young.
_Tubal Cain._
ELLEN STURGIS HOOPER. 1816-1841.
    I slept, and dreamed that life was Beauty;
    I woke, and found that life was Duty.
    Was thy dream then a shadowy lie?
    Toil on, poor heart, unceasingly;
    And thou shalt find thy dream to be
    A truth and noonday light to thee.
_Life a Duty._
PHILIP JAMES BAILEY. 1816- ----.
    We live in deeds, not years; in thoughts, not breaths;
    In feelings, not in figures on a dial.
    We should count time by heart-throbs. He most lives
    Who thinks most, feels the noblest, acts the best.
    Life 's but a means unto an end; that end
    Beginning, mean, and end to all things,--God.
_Festus. Scene, A Country Town._
    Poets are all who love, who feel great truths,
    And tell them; and the truth of truths is love.

    America! half-brother of the world!
    With something good and bad of every land.
_Scene, The Surface._
ELIZA COOK. 1817- ----.
    I love it, I love it, and who shall dare
    To chide me for loving that old arm-chair?
_The Old Arm-Chair._
    How cruelly sweet are the echoes that start
    When memory plays an old tune on the heart!
_Old Dobbin._
NATHANIEL P. WILLIS. 1817-1867.
     At present there is no distinction among the upper ten thousand
     of the city.
_Necessity for a Promenade Drive._
    For it stirs the blood in an old man's heart,
      And makes his pulses fly,
    To catch the thrill of a happy voice
      And the light of a pleasant eye.
_Saturday Afternoon._
    It is the month of June,
      The month of leaves and roses,
    When pleasant sights salute the eyes,
      And pleasant scents the noses.
_The Month of June._
    Let us weep in our darkness, but weep not for him!
    Not for him who, departing, leaves millions in tears!
    Not for him who has died full of honor and years!
    Not for him who ascended Fame's ladder so high
    From the round at the top he has stepped to the sky.
_The Death of Harrison._
WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING. 1817- ----.
    I laugh, for hope hath happy place with me;
    If my bark sinks, 't is to another sea.
_A Poet's Hope._
    I sing New England, as she lights her fire
    In every Prairie's midst; and where the bright
    Enchanting stars shine pure through Southern night,
    She still is there, the guardian on the tower,
    To open for the world a purer hour.
_New England._
    Most joyful let the Poet be;
    It is through him that all men see.
_The Poet of the Old and New Times._
JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL. 1819-1891.
    Earth's noblest thing,--a woman perfected.
_Irené._
    Be noble! and the nobleness that lies
    In other men, sleeping but never dead,
    Will rise in majesty to meet thine own.
_Sonnet iv._
    Great truths are portions of the soul of man;
    Great souls are portions of eternity.
_Sonnet vi._
    To win the secret of a weed's plain heart.
_Sonnet xxv._
    Two meanings have our lightest fantasies,
    One of the flesh, and of the spirit one.
_Sonnet xxxiv._ (_Ed. 1844._)
    All thoughts that mould the age begin
    Deep down within the primitive soul.
_An Incident in a Railroad Car._
    It may be glorious to write
    Thoughts that shall glad the two or three
    High souls, like those far stars that come in sight
    Once in a century.
_An Incident in a Railroad Car._
    No man is born into the world whose work
    Is not born with him. There is always work,
    And tools to work withal, for those who will;
    And blessed are the horny hands of toil.
_A Glance behind the Curtain._
    They are slaves who fear to speak
    For the fallen and the weak.
         .     .     .     .     .
    They are slaves who dare not be
    In the right with two or three.
_Stanzas on Freedom._
    Endurance is the crowning quality,
    And patience all the passion of great hearts.
_Columbus._
               One day with life and heart
    Is more than time enough to find a world.
_Columbus._
    Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide,
    In the strife of Truth with Falsehood, for the good or evil side;
    Some great cause, God's new Messiah offering each the bloom or blight,
    Parts the goats upon the left hand, and the sheep upon the right;
    And the choice goes by forever 'twixt that darkness and that light.
_The Present Crisis._
    Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne.
_The Present Crisis._
    Then to side with Truth is noble when we share her wretched crust,
    Ere her cause bring fame and profit, and 't is prosperous to be just;
    Then it is the brave man chooses, while the coward stands aside,
    Doubting in his abject spirit, till his Lord is crucified.
_The Present Crisis._
    Before man made us citizens, great Nature made us men.
_On the Capture of Fugitive Slaves near Washington._
    Dear common flower, that grow'st beside the way,
    Fringing the dusty road with harmless gold.
_To the Dandelion._
    This child is not mine as the first was;
      I cannot sing it to rest;
    I cannot lift it up fatherly,
      And bless it upon my breast.
    Yet it lies in my little one's cradle,
      And sits in my little one's chair,
    And the light of the heaven she 's gone to
      Transfigures its golden hair.
_The Changeling._
    The thing we long for, that we are
    For one transcendent moment.
_Longing._
    She doeth little kindnesses
    Which most leave undone, or despise.
_My Love. iv._
    Not only around our infancy
    Doth heaven with all its splendors lie;
    Daily, with souls that cringe and plot,
    We Sinais climb and know it not.
_The Vision of Sir Launfal. Prelude to Part First._
      'T is heaven alone that is given away;
    'T is only God may be had for the asking.
_The Vision of Sir Launfal. Prelude to Part First._
    And what is so rare as a day in June?
      Then, if ever, come perfect days;
    Then Heaven tries the earth if it be in tune,
      And over it softly her warm ear lays.
_The Vision of Sir Launfal. Prelude to Part First._
    Now the heart is so full that a drop overfills it;
    We are happy now because God wills it.
_The Vision of Sir Launfal. Prelude to Part First._
    Joy comes, grief goes, we know not how.

_To George William Curtis._
    But life is sweet, though all that makes it sweet
    Lessen like sound of friends' departing feet;
    And Death is beautiful as feet of friend
    Coming with welcome at our journey's end.
    For me Fate gave, whate'er she else denied,
    A nature sloping to the southern side;
    I thank her for it, though when clouds arise
    Such natures double-darken gloomy skies.
_To George William Curtis._
    In life's small things be resolute and great
    To keep thy muscle trained: know'st thou when Fate
    Thy measure takes, or when she 'll say to thee,
    "I find thee worthy; do this deed for me"?

     There is no better ballast for keeping the mind steady on its
     keel, and saving it from all risk of crankiness, than business.

     It was in making education not only common to all, but in some

     Talent is that which is in a man's power; genius is that in whose
     power a man is.
_Among my Books. First Series. Rousseau and the Sentimentalists._
     There is no work of genius which has not been the delight of
     mankind, no word of genius to which the human heart and soul have

_Among my Books. First Series. Rousseau and the Sentimentalists._
     Every man feels instinctively that all the beautiful sentiments

     dealing with himself.

     sublime irrecognition of the unessential.
_Among my Books. Second Series. Dante._
     Whoever can endure unmixed delight, whoever can tolerate music
     and painting and poetry all in one, whoever wishes to be rid of
     thought and to let the busy anvils of the brain be silent for a
     time, let him read in the "Faery Queen."

     delightfully fortuitous inconsequence that is the adamantine
     logic of dreamland.
_Coleridge._
     He gives us the very quintessence of perception,--the clearly
     crystalized precipitation of all that is most precious in the
     ferment of impression after the impertinent and obtrusive
     particulars have evaporated from the memory.
_Coleridge._
     If I were asked what book is better than a cheap book, I should

     is a book honestly come by.

LEONARD HEATH.
    On a lone barren isle, where the wild roaring billows
      Assail the stern rock, and the loud tempests rave,
    The hero lies still, while the dew-drooping willows,
      Like fond weeping mourners, lean over his grave.
    The lightnings may flash and the loud thunders rattle;
      He heeds not, he hears not, he 's free from all pain;
    He sleeps his last sleep, he has fought his last battle;
     No sound can awake him to glory again!
_The Grave of Bonaparte._
    Yet spirit immortal, the tomb cannot bind thee,
      But like thine own eagle that soars to the sun
    Thou springest from bondage and leavest behind thee
      A name which before thee no mortal hath won.
    Tho' nations may combat, and war's thunders rattle,
      No more on thy steed wilt thou sweep o'er the plain:
    Thou sleep'st thy last sleep, thou hast fought thy last battle,
      No sound can awake thee to glory again.
_The Grave of Bonaparte._

     which is the one pre-eminent distinction, the royalty of virtue.

(_Translation by J. Bostock, M. D., and H. T. Riley, B. A., with slight
alterations._[716-4])

     The world, and whatever that be which we call the heavens, by the
     vault of which all things are enclosed, we must conceive to be a
     deity, to be eternal, without bounds, neither created nor subject

     concern of man; nor can the human mind form any conjecture
     concerning it.

     man before the fortieth day from his birth, and then it is looked
     upon as a miracle of precocity.
_Natural History, Book vii. Sect. 2._
     Man is the only one that knows nothing, that can learn nothing
     without being taught. He can neither speak nor walk nor eat, and
     in short he can do nothing at the prompting of nature only, but
     weep.
_Natural History, Book vii. Sect. 4._
     With man, most of his misfortunes are occasioned by man.
_Natural History, Book vii. Sect. 5._
     Indeed, what is there that does not appear marvellous when it

     their throat.

     finding him, the tradition says, stripped to the work.
_Natural History. Book xviii. Sect. 20._
     The agricultural population, says Cato, produces the bravest men,

     It was a custom with Apelles, to which he most tenaciously
     adhered, never to let any day pass, however busy he might be,
     without exercising himself by tracing some outline or other,--a
     practice which has now passed into a proverb.[720-4] It was also
     a practice with him, when he had completed a work, to exhibit it
     to the view of the passers-by in his studio, while he himself,
     concealed behind the picture, would listen to the criticisms. . .
     . Under these circumstances, they say that he was censured by a
     shoemaker for having represented the shoes with one latchet too
     few. The next day, the shoemaker, quite proud at seeing the
     former error corrected, thanks to his advice, began to criticise
     the leg; upon which Apelles, full of indignation, popped his head
     out and reminded him that a shoemaker should give no opinion
     beyond the shoes,[721-1]--a piece of advice which has equally
     passed into a proverbial saying.

_Consolation to Apollonius._
     About Pontus there are some creatures of such an extempore being
     that the whole term of their life is confined within the space of

     die.

     the length.
_Consolation to Apollonius._
     For many, as Cranton tells us, and those very wise men, not now
     but long ago, have deplored the condition of human nature,
     esteeming life a punishment, and to be born a man the highest
     pitch of calamity; this, Aristotle tells us, Silenus declared
     when he was brought captive to Midas.
_Consolation to Apollonius._
     There are two sentences inscribed upon the Delphic oracle, hugely

     desired him not to speak of it till he had children of his own.

_Of Hearing. 6._
     Antiphanes said merrily, that in a certain city the cold was so

     As those persons who despair of ever being rich make little
     account of small expenses, thinking that little added to a little
     will never make any great sum.
_Of Man's Progress in Virtue._
     What is bigger than an elephant? But this also is become man's
     plaything, and a spectacle at public solemnities; and it learns
     to skip, dance, and kneel.
_Of Fortune._

     if something doth not appear among us with which the ancients
     were acquainted.
_Symposiacs. Book viii. Question ix._
     Why does pouring oil on the sea make it clear and calm? Is it for
     that the winds, slipping the smooth oil, have no force, nor cause
     any waves?
     The great god Pan is dead.
_Why the Oracles cease to give Answers._
     I am whatever was, or is, or will be; and my veil no mortal ever

     time see both forward and backward.
_Whether an Aged Man ought to meddle in State Affairs._
     Statesmen are not only liable to give an account of what they say
     or do in public, but there is a busy inquiry made into their very
     meals, beds, marriages, and every other sportive or serious
     action.
_Political Precepts._
     Leo Byzantius said, "What would you do, if you saw my wife, who
     scarce reaches up to my knees? . . . Yet," went he on, "as little
     as we are, when we fall out with each other, the city of
     Byzantium is not big enough to hold us."

     not be altogether cleared from injustice in dealing with beasts

EPICTETUS. _Circa_ 60 A. D.
(_The translation used here is that of Thomas Wentworth Higginson, based
on that of Elizabeth Carter_ (1866).)
     To a reasonable creature, that alone is insupportable which is
     unreasonable; but everything reasonable may be supported.
_Discourses. Chap. ii._
     Yet God hath not only granted these faculties, by which we may
     bear every event without being depressed or broken by it, but
     like a good prince and a true father, hath placed their exercise
     above restraint, compulsion, or hindrance, and wholly without our
     own control.
_Discourses. Chap. vi._
     In a word, neither death, nor exile, nor pain, nor anything of
     this kind is the real cause of our doing or not doing any action,
     but our inward opinions and principles.
_Discourses. Chap. xi._
     Reason is not measured by size or height, but by principle.
_Discourses. Chap. xii._
     O slavish man! will you not bear with your own brother, who has
     God for his Father, as being a son from the same stock, and of
     the same high descent? But if you chance to be placed in some
     superior station, will you presently set yourself up for a
     tyrant?
_Discourses. Chap. xiii._
     When you have shut your doors, and darkened your room, remember
     never to say that you are alone, for you are not alone; but God
     is within, and your genius is within,--and what need have they of
     light to see what you are doing?
_Discourses. Chap. xiv._
     No great thing is created suddenly, any more than a bunch of
     grapes or a fig. If you tell me that you desire a fig, I answer
     you that there must be time. Let it first blossom, then bear
     fruit, then ripen.
_Discourses. Chap. xv._
     Any one thing in the creation is sufficient to demonstrate a
     Providence to an humble and grateful mind.
_Discourses. Chap. xvi._
     Were I a nightingale, I would act the part of a nightingale; were
     I a swan, the part of a swan.
_Discourses. Chap. xvi._
     Since it is Reason which shapes and regulates all other things,
     it ought not itself to be left in disorder.
_Discourses. Chap. xvii._
     If what the philosophers say be true,--that all men's actions
     proceed from one source; that as they assent from a persuasion
     that a thing is so, and dissent from a persuasion that it is not,
     and suspend their judgment from a persuasion that it is
     uncertain,--so likewise they seek a thing from a persuasion that
     it is for their advantage.
_Discourses. Chap. xviii._
     Practise yourself, for heaven's sake, in little things; and
     thence proceed to greater.

     principal objects.
_Discourses. Chap. xx._
     Why, then, do you walk as if you had swallowed a ramrod?
_Discourses. Chap. xxi._
     When one maintains his proper attitude in life, he does not long
     after externals. What would you have, O man?
_Discourses. Chap. xxi._
     Difficulties are things that show what men are.
_Discourses. Chap. xxiv._
     If we are not stupid or insincere when we say that the good or
     ill of man lies within his own will, and that all beside is
     nothing to us, why are we still troubled?
_Discourses. Chap. xxv._
     In theory there is nothing to hinder our following what we are
     taught; but in life there are many things to draw us aside.
_Discourses. Chap. xxvi._
     Appearances to the mind are of four kinds. Things either are what
     they appear to be; or they neither are, nor appear to be; or they
     are, and do not appear to be; or they are not, and yet appear to
     be. Rightly to aim in all these cases is the wise man's task.
_Discourses. Chap. xxvii._
     The appearance of things to the mind is the standard of every
     action to man.
_That we ought not to be angry with Mankind. Chap. xxviii._
     The essence of good and evil is a certain disposition of the
     will.
_Of Courage. Chap. xxix._
     It is not reasonings that are wanted now; for there are books
     stuffed full of stoical reasonings.
_Of Courage. Chap. xxix._
     For what constitutes a child?--Ignorance. What constitutes a
     child?--Want of instruction; for they are our equals so far as
     their degree of knowledge permits.
_That Courage is not inconsistent with Caution. Book ii. Chap. i._
     Appear to know only this,--never to fail nor fall.
_That Courage is not inconsistent with Caution. Book ii. Chap. i._
     The materials of action are variable, but the use we make of them
     should be constant.
_How Nobleness of Mind may be consistent with Prudence. Chap. v._
     Shall I show you the muscular training of a philosopher? "What
     muscles are those?"--A will undisappointed; evils avoided; powers
     daily exercised; careful resolutions; unerring decisions.
_Wherein consists the Essence of Good. Chap. viii._
     Dare to look up to God and say, "Make use of me for the future as
     Thou wilt. I am of the same mind; I am one with Thee. I refuse
     nothing which seems good to Thee. Lead me whither Thou wilt.
     Clothe me in whatever dress Thou wilt."
_That we do not study to make Use of the established Principles
concerning Good and Evil. Chap. xvi._
     What is the first business of one who studies philosophy? To part
     with self-conceit. For it is impossible for any one to begin to
     learn what he thinks that he already knows.
_How to apply general Principles to particular Cases. Chap. xvii._
     Every habit and faculty is preserved and increased by
     correspondent actions,--as the habit of walking, by walking; of
     running, by running.
_How the Semblances of Things are to be combated. Chap. xviii._
     Whatever you would make habitual, practise it; and if you would
     not make a thing habitual, do not practise it, but habituate
     yourself to something else.
_How the Semblances of Things are to be combated. Chap. xviii._
     Reckon the days in which you have not been angry. I used to be
     angry every day; now every other day; then every third and fourth
     day; and if you miss it so long as thirty days, offer a sacrifice
     of thanksgiving to God.
_How the Semblances of Things are to be combated. Chap. xviii._
     Be not hurried away by excitement, but say, "Semblance, wait for
     me a little. Let me see what you are and what you represent. Let
     me try you."
_How the Semblances of Things are to be combated. Chap. xviii._
     Things true and evident must of necessity be recognized by those
     who would contradict them.
_Concerning the Epicureans. Chap. xx._
     There are some things which men confess with ease, and others
     with difficulty.
_Of Inconsistency. Chap. xxi._
     Who is there whom bright and agreeable children do not attract to
     play and creep and prattle with them?
_Concerning a Person whom he treated with Disregard. Chap. xxiv._
     Two rules we should always have ready,--that there is nothing
     good or evil save in the will; and that we are not to lead
     events, but to follow them.
_In what Manner we ought to bear Sickness. Book iii. Chap. x._
     In every affair consider what precedes and what follows, and then
     undertake it.
_That Everything is to be undertaken with Circumspection. Chap. xv._
     There is a fine circumstance connected with the character of a
     Cynic,--that he must be beaten like an ass, and yet when beaten
     must love those who beat him, as the father, as the brother of
     all.
_Of the Cynic Philosophy. Chap. xxii._
     First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you
     have to do.
_Concerning such as read and dispute ostentatiously. Chap. xxiii._
     Let not another's disobedience to Nature become an ill to you;
     for you were not born to be depressed and unhappy with others,
     but to be happy with them. And if any is unhappy, remember that
     he is so for himself; for God made all men to enjoy felicity and
     peace.
_That we ought not to be affected by Things not in our own Power. Chap.
xxiv._
     Everything has two handles,--one by which it may be borne;
     another by which it cannot.

     He possessed a peculiar talent of producing effect in whatever he
     said or did.

_Letters._[748-1] _Book i. Letter v. 14._
     There is nothing to write about, you say. Well, then, write and

     or tell me in the good old style if you are well. That 's right.
     I am quite well.

     Objects which are usually the motives of our travels by land and

     eye. . . . We put off from time to time going and seeing what we
     know we have an opportunity of seeing when we please.

     Find time still to be learning somewhat good, and give up being
     desultory.
_Meditations. ii. 7._
     No state sorrier than that of the man who keeps up a continual
     round, and pries into "the secrets of the nether world," as saith
     the poet, and is curious in conjecture of what is in his
     neighbour's heart.
_Meditations. ii. 13._
     Though thou be destined to live three thousand years and as many
     myriads besides, yet remember that no man loseth other life than
     that which he liveth, nor liveth other than that which he loseth.
_Meditations. ii. 14._
     For a man can lose neither the past nor the future; for how can
     one take from him that which is not his? So remember these two
     points: first, that each thing is of like form from everlasting
     and comes round again in its cycle, and that it signifies not
     whether a man shall look upon the same things for a hundred years
     or two hundred, or for an infinity of time; second, that the
     longest lived and the shortest lived man, when they come to die,
     lose one and the same thing.
_Meditations. ii. 14._
     As for life, it is a battle and a sojourning in a strange land;
     but the fame that comes after is oblivion.
_Meditations. ii. 17._
     Waste not the remnant of thy life in those imaginations touching
     other folk, whereby thou contributest not to the common weal.
_Meditations. iii. 4._
     The lot assigned to every man is suited to him, and suits him to
     itself.
_Meditations. iii. 4._
     Be not unwilling in what thou doest, neither selfish nor
     unadvised nor obstinate; let not over-refinement deck out thy
     thought; be not wordy nor a busybody.
_Meditations. iii. 5._
     A man should _be_ upright, not be _kept_ upright.
_Meditations. iii. 5._
     Never esteem anything as of advantage to thee that shall make
     thee break thy word or lose thy self-respect.
_Meditations. iii. 7._
     Respect the faculty that forms thy judgments.
_Meditations. iii. 9._
     Remember that man's life lies all within this present, as 't were
     but a hair's-breadth of time; as for the rest, the past is gone,
     the future yet unseen. Short, therefore, is man's life, and
     narrow is the corner of the earth wherein he dwells.
_Meditations. iii. 10._
     Nothing has such power to broaden the mind as the ability to
     investigate systematically and truly all that comes under thy
     observation in life.
_Meditations. iii. 11._
     As surgeons keep their instruments and knives always at hand for
     cases requiring immediate treatment, so shouldst thou have thy
     thoughts ready to understand things divine and human, remembering
     in thy every act, even the smallest, how close is the bond that
     unites the two.
_Meditations. iii. 13._
     The ruling power within, when it is in its natural state, is so
     related to outer circumstances that it easily changes to accord
     with what can be done and what is given it to do.
_Meditations. iv. 1._
     Let no act be done at haphazard, nor otherwise than according to
     the finished rules that govern its kind.
_Meditations. iv. 2._
     By a tranquil mind I mean nothing else than a mind well ordered.
_Meditations. iv. 3._
     Think on this doctrine,--that reasoning beings were created for
     one another's sake; that to be patient is a branch of justice,
     and that men sin without intending it.
_Meditations. iv. 3._
     The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it.
_Meditations. iv. 3._
     Nothing can come out of nothing, any more than a thing can go
     back to nothing.
_Meditations. iv. 4._
     Death, like generation, is a secret of Nature.
_Meditations. iv. 5._
     That which makes the man no worse than he was makes his life no
     worse: it has no power to harm, without or within.
_Meditations. iv. 8._
     Whatever happens at all happens as it should; thou wilt find this
     true, if thou shouldst watch narrowly.
_Meditations. iv. 10._
     Many the lumps of frankincense on the same altar; one falls there
     early and another late, but it makes no difference.
_Meditations. iv. 15._
     Be not as one that hath ten thousand years to live; death is nigh
     at hand: while thou livest, while thou hast time, be good.
_Meditations. iv. 17._
     How much time he gains who does not look to see what his
     neighbour says or does or thinks, but only at what he does
     himself, to make it just and holy.
_Meditations. iv. 18._
     Whatever is in any way beautiful hath its source of beauty in
     itself, and is complete in itself; praise forms no part of it. So
     it is none the worse nor the better for being praised.
_Meditations. iv. 20._
     Doth perfect beauty stand in need of praise at all? Nay; no more
     than law, no more than truth, no more than loving kindness, nor
     than modesty.
_Meditations. iv. 20._
     All that is harmony for thee, O Universe, is in harmony with me
     as well. Nothing that comes at the right time for thee is too
     early or too late for me. Everything is fruit to me that thy
     seasons bring, O Nature. All things come of thee, have their
     being in thee, and return to thee.
_Meditations. iv. 23._
     "Let thine occupations be few," saith the sage,[752-1] "if thou
     wouldst lead a tranquil life."
_Meditations. iv. 24._
     Love the little trade which thou hast learned, and be content
     therewith.
_Meditations. iv. 31._
     Remember this,--that there is a proper dignity and proportion to
     be observed in the performance of every act of life.
_Meditations. iv. 32._
     All is ephemeral,--fame and the famous as well.
_Meditations. iv. 35._
     Observe always that everything is the result of a change, and get
     used to thinking that there is nothing Nature loves so well as to
     change existing forms and to make new ones like them.
_Meditations. iv. 36._
     Search men's governing principles, and consider the wise, what
     they shun and what they cleave to.
_Meditations. iv. 38._
     Time is a sort of river of passing events, and strong is its
     current; no sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept
     by and another takes its place, and this too will be swept away.
_Meditations. iv. 43._
     All that happens is as usual and familiar as the rose in spring
     and the crop in summer.
_Meditations. iv. 44._
     That which comes after ever conforms to that which has gone
     before.
_Meditations. iv. 45._
     Mark how fleeting and paltry is the estate of man,--yesterday in
     embryo, to-morrow a mummy or ashes. So for the hair's-breadth of
     time assigned to thee live rationally, and part with life
     cheerfully, as drops the ripe olive, extolling the season that
     bore it and the tree that matured it.
_Meditations. iv. 48._
     Deem not life a thing of consequence. For look at the yawning
     void of the future, and at that other limitless space, the past.
_Meditations. iv. 50._
     Always take the short cut; and that is the rational one.
     Therefore say and do everything according to soundest reason.
_Meditations. iv. 51._
     In the morning, when thou art sluggish at rousing thee, let this
     thought be present; "I am rising to a man's work."
_Meditations. v. 1._
     A man makes no noise over a good deed, but passes on to another
     as a vine to bear grapes again in season.
_Meditations. v. 6._
     Flinch not, neither give up nor despair, if the achieving of
     every act in accordance with right principle is not always
     continuous with thee.
_Meditations. v. 9._
     Nothing happens to anybody which he is not fitted by nature to
     bear.
_Meditations. v. 18._
     Prize that which is best in the universe; and this is that which
     useth everything and ordereth everything.
_Meditations. v. 21._
     Live with the gods.
_Meditations. v. 27._
     Look beneath the surface; let not the several quality of a thing
     nor its worth escape thee.
_Meditations. vi. 3._
     The controlling Intelligence understands its own nature, and what
     it does, and whereon it works.
_Meditations. vi. 5._
     Do not think that what is hard for thee to master is impossible
     for man; but if a thing is possible and proper to man, deem it
     attainable by thee.
_Meditations. vi. 19._
     If any man can convince me and bring home to me that I do not
     think or act aright, gladly will I change; for I search after
     truth, by which man never yet was harmed. But he is harmed who
     abideth on still in his deception and ignorance.
_Meditations. vi. 21._
     Death,--a stopping of impressions through the senses, and of the
     pulling of the cords of motion, and of the ways of thought, and
     of service to the flesh.
_Meditations. vi. 28._
     Suit thyself to the estate in which thy lot is cast.
_Meditations. vi. 39._
     What is not good for the swarm is not good for the bee.
_Meditations. vi. 54._
     How many, once lauded in song, are given over to the forgotten;
     and how many who sung their praises are clean gone long ago!
_Meditations. vii. 6._
     One Universe made up of all that is; and one God in it all, and
     one principle of Being, and one Law, the Reason, shared by all
     thinking creatures, and one Truth.
_Meditations. vii. 9._
     To a rational being it is the same thing to act according to
     nature and according to reason.
_Meditations. vii. 11._
     Let not thy mind run on what thou lackest as much as on what thou
     hast already.
_Meditations. vii. 27._
     Just as the sand-dunes, heaped one upon another, hide each the
     first, so in life the former deeds are quickly hidden by those
     that follow after.
_Meditations. vii. 34._
     The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing, in so far
     as it stands ready against the accidental and the unforeseen, and
     is not apt to fall.
_Meditations. vii. 61._
     Remember this,--that very little is needed to make a happy life.
_Meditations. vii. 67._
     Remember that to change thy mind and to follow him that sets thee
     right, is to be none the less the free agent that thou wast
     before.
_Meditations. viii. 16._
     Look to the essence of a thing, whether it be a point of
     doctrine, of practice, or of interpretation.
_Meditations. viii. 22._
     A man's happiness,--to do the things proper to man.
_Meditations. viii. 26._
     Be not careless in deeds, nor confused in words, nor rambling in
     thought.
_Meditations. viii. 51._
     He that knows not what the world is, knows not where he is
     himself. He that knows not for what he was made, knows not what
     he is nor what the world is.
_Meditations. viii. 52._
     The nature of the universe is the nature of things that are. Now,
     things that are have kinship with things that are from the
     beginning. Further, this nature is styled Truth; and it is the
     first cause of all that is true.
_Meditations. ix. 1._
     He would be the finer gentleman that should leave the world
     without having tasted of lying or pretence of any sort, or of
     wantonness or conceit.
_Meditations. ix. 2._
     Think not disdainfully of death, but look on it with favour; for
     even death is one of the things that Nature wills.
_Meditations. ix. 3._
     A wrong-doer is often a man that has left something undone, not
     always he that has done something.
_Meditations. ix. 5._
     Blot out vain pomp; check impulse; quench appetite; keep reason
     under its own control.
_Meditations. ix. 7._
     Things that have a common quality ever quickly seek their kind.
_Meditations. ix. 9._
     All things are the same,--familiar in enterprise, momentary in
     endurance, coarse in substance. All things now are as they were
     in the day of those whom we have buried.
_Meditations. ix. 14._
     The happiness and unhappiness of the rational, social animal
     depends not on what he feels but on what he does; just as his
     virtue and vice consist not in feeling but in doing.
_Meditations. ix. 16._
     Everything is in a state of metamorphosis. Thou thyself art in
     everlasting change and in corruption to correspond; so is the
     whole universe.
_Meditations. ix. 19._
     Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any
     shall note it. . . . Be satisfied with success in even the
     smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle.
_Meditations. ix. 29._
     He that dies in extreme old age will be reduced to the same state
     with him that is cut down untimely.
_Meditations. ix. 33._
     Whatever may befall thee, it was preordained for thee from
     everlasting.
_Meditations. x. 5._
     "The earth loveth the shower," and "the holy ether knoweth what
     love is."[756-1] The Universe, too, loves to create whatsoever is
     destined to be made.
_Meditations. x. 21._
     Remember that what pulls the strings is the force hidden within;
     there lies the power to persuade, there the life,--there, if one
     must speak out, the real man.
_Meditations. x. 38._
     No form of Nature is inferior to Art; for the arts merely imitate
     natural forms.
_Meditations. xi. 10._
     If it is not seemly, do it not; if it is not true, speak it not.
_Meditations. xii. 17._
TERTULLIAN. 160-240 A. D.
     See how these Christians love one another.
_Apologeticus. c. 39._
     Blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church.
_Apologeticus. c. 50._
     It is certain because it is impossible.

DIOGENES LAERTIUS. _Circa_ 200 A. D.
(_From "The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers." Translated by C.
D. Yonge, B. A., with occasional corrections. Bohn's Classical Library._)
     Alcæus mentions Aristodemus in these  lines:
    'T is money makes the man; and he who 's none
    Is counted neither good nor honourable.
_Thales. vii._
     Thales said there was no difference between life and death. "Why,
     then," said some one to him, "do not you die?" "Because," said
     he, "it _does_ make no difference."
_Thales. ix._
     When Thales was asked what was difficult, he said, "To know one's
     self." And what was easy, "To advise another."
_Thales. ix._
     He said that men ought to remember those friends who were absent
     as well as those who were present.
_Thales. ix._
     The apophthegm "Know thyself" is his.
_Thales. xiii._
     Writers differ with respect to the apophthegms of the Seven
     Sages, attributing the same one to various authors.
_Thales. xiv._
     Solon used to say that speech was the image of actions; . . .
     that laws were like cobwebs,--for that if any trifling or
     powerless thing fell into them, they held it fast; while if it
     were something weightier, it broke through them and was off.
_Solon. x._
     Solon gave the following advice: "Consider your honour, as a
     gentleman, of more weight than an oath. Never tell a lie. Pay
     attention to matters of importance."
_Solon. xii._
     As some say, Solon was the author of the apophthegm, "Nothing in
     excess."
_Solon. xvi._
     Chilo advised, "not to speak evil of the dead."
_Chilo. ii._
     Pittacus said that half was more than the whole.
_Pittacus. ii._
     Heraclitus says that Pittacus, when he had got Alcæus into his
     power, released him, saying, "Forgiveness is better than
     revenge."
_Pittacus. iii._
     One of his sayings was, "Even the gods cannot strive against
     necessity."
_Pittacus. iv._
     Another was, "Watch your opportunity."
_Pittacus. vii._
     Bias used to say that men ought to calculate life both as if they
     were fated to live a long and a short time, and that they ought
     to love one another as if at a future time they would come to
     hate one another; for that most men were bad.
_Bias. v._
     Ignorance plays the chief part among men, and the multitude of
     words;[758-5] but opportunity will prevail.
_Cleobulus. iv._
     The saying, "Practice is everything," is Periander's.
_Periander. vi._
     Anarcharsis, on learning that the sides of a ship were four
     fingers thick, said that "the passengers were just that distance
     from death."
_Anarcharsis. v._
     He used to say that it was better to have one friend of great
     value than many friends who were good for nothing.
_Anarcharsis. v._
     It was a common saying of Myson that men ought not to investigate
     things from words, but words from things; for that things are not
     made for the sake of words, but words for things.
_Myson. iii._
     Epimenides was sent by his father into the field to look for a
     sheep, turned out of the road at mid-day and lay down in a
     certain cave and fell asleep, and slept there fifty-seven years;
     and after that, when awake, he went on looking for the sheep,
     thinking that he had been taking a short nap.
_Epimenides. ii._
     There are many marvellous stories told of Pherecydes. For it is
     said that he was walking along the seashore at Samos, and that
     seeing a ship sailing by with a fair wind, he said that it would
     soon sink; and presently it sank before his eyes. At another time
     he was drinking some water which had been drawn up out of a well,
     and he foretold that within three days there would be an
     earthquake; and there was one.
_Pherecydes. ii._
     Anaximander used to assert that the primary cause of all things
     was the Infinite,--not defining exactly whether he meant air or
     water or anything else.
_Anaximander. ii._
     Anaxagoras said to a man who was grieving because he was dying in
     a foreign land, "The descent to Hades is the same from every
     place."
_Anaxagoras. vi._
     Aristophanes turns Socrates into ridicule in his comedies, as
     making the worse appear the better reason.
_Socrates. v._
     Often when he was looking on at auctions he would say, "How many
     things there are which I do not need!"
_Socrates. x._
     Socrates said, "Those who want fewest things are nearest to the
     gods."
_Socrates. xi._
     He said that there was one only good, namely, knowledge; and one
     only evil, namely, ignorance.
_Socrates. xiv._
     He declared that he knew nothing, except the fact of his
     ignorance.
_Socrates. xvi._
     Being asked whether it was better to marry or not, he replied,
     "Whichever you do, you will repent it."
_Socrates. xvi._
     He used to say that other men lived to eat, but that he ate to
     live.
_Socrates. xvi._
     Aristippus being asked what were the most necessary things for
     well-born boys to learn, said, "Those things which they will put
     in practice when they become men."
_Aristippus. iv._
     Aristippus said that a wise man's country was the world.
_Aristippus. xiii._
     Like sending owls to Athens, as the proverb goes.

     Plato affirmed that the soul was immortal and clothed in many
     bodies successively.
_Plato. xl._
     Time is the image of eternity.
_Plato. xli._
     That virtue was sufficient of herself for happiness.
_Plato. xlii._
     That the gods superintend all the affairs of men, and that there
     are such beings as dæmons.
_Plato. xlii._
     There is a written and an unwritten law. The one by which we
     regulate our constitutions in our cities is the written law; that
     which arises from custom is the unwritten law.
_Plato. li._
     Plato was continually saying to Xenocrates, "Sacrifice to the
     Graces."
_Xenocrates. iii._
     Arcesilaus had a peculiar habit while conversing of using the
     expression, "My opinion is," and "So and so will not agree to
     this."
_Arcesilaus. xii._
     Bion used to say that the way to the shades below was easy; he
     could go there with his eyes shut.
_Bion. iii._
     Once when Bion was at sea in the company of some wicked men, he
     fell into the hands of pirates; and when the rest said, "We are
     undone if we are known,"--"But I," said he, "am undone if we are
     not known."
_Bion. iii._
     Of a rich man who was niggardly he said, "That man does not own
     his estate, but his estate owns him."
_Bion. iii._
     Bion insisted on the principle that "The property of friends is
     common."
_Bion. ix._
     Very late in life, when he was studying geometry, some one said
     to Lacydes, "Is it then a time for you to be learning now?" "If
     it is not," he replied, "when will it be?"
_Lacydes. v._
     Aristotle was once asked what those who tell lies gain by it.
     Said he, "That when they speak truth they are not believed."
_Aristotle. xi._
     The question was put to him, what hope is; and his answer was,
     "The dream of a waking man."
_Aristotle. xi._
     He used to say that personal beauty was a better introduction
     than any letter;[761-3] but others say that it was Diogenes who
     gave this description of it, while Aristotle called beauty "the
     gift of God;" that Socrates called it "a short-lived tyranny;"
     Theophrastus, "a silent deceit;" Theocritus, "an ivory mischief;"
     Carneades, "a sovereignty which stood in need of no guards."
_Aristotle. xi._
     On one occasion Aristotle was asked how much educated men were
     superior to those uneducated: "As much," said he, "as the living
     are to the dead."
_Aristotle. xi._
     It was a saying of his that education was an ornament in
     prosperity and a refuge in adversity.
_Aristotle. xi._
     He was once asked what a friend is, and his answer was, "One soul
     abiding in two bodies."
_Aristotle. xi._
     Asked what he gained from philosophy, he answered, "To do without
     being commanded what others do from fear of the laws."
_Aristotle. xi._
     The question was once put to him, how we ought to behave to our
     friends; and the answer he gave was, "As we should wish our
     friends to behave to us."
_Aristotle. xi._
     He used to define justice as "a virtue of the soul distributing
     that which each person deserved."
_Aristotle. xi._
     Another of his sayings was, that education was the best viaticum
     of old age.
_Aristotle. xi._
     The chief good he has defined to be the exercise of virtue in a
     perfect life.
_Aristotle. xiii._
     He used to teach that God is incorporeal, as Plato also asserted,
     and that his providence extends over all the heavenly bodies.
_Aristotle. xiii._
     It was a favourite expression of Theophrastus that time was the
     most valuable thing that a man could spend.
_Theophrastus. x._
     Antisthenes used to say that envious people were devoured by
     their own disposition, just as iron is by rust.
_Antisthenes. iv._
     When he was praised by some wicked men, he said, "I am sadly
     afraid that I must have done some wicked thing."
_Antisthenes. iv._
     When asked what learning was the most necessary, he said, "Not to
     unlearn what you have learned."
_Antisthenes. iv._
     Diogenes would frequently praise those who were about to marry,
     and yet did not marry.
_Diogenes. iv._
     "Bury me on my face," said Diogenes; and when he was asked why,
     he replied, "Because in a little while everything will be turned
     upside down."
_Diogenes. vi._
     One of the sayings of Diogenes was that most men were within a
     finger's breadth of being mad; for if a man walked with his
     middle finger pointing out, folks would think him mad, but not so
     if it were his forefinger.
_Diogenes. vi._
     All things are in common among friends.
_Diogenes. vi._
     "Be of good cheer," said Diogenes; "I see land."
_Diogenes. vi._
     Plato having defined man to be a two-legged animal without
     feathers, Diogenes plucked a cock and brought it into the
     Academy, and said, "This is Plato's man." On which account this
     addition was made to the definition,--"With broad flat nails."
_Diogenes. vi._
     A man once asked Diogenes what was the proper time for supper,
     and he made answer, "If you are a rich man, whenever you please;
     and if you are a poor man, whenever you can."
_Diogenes. vi._
     Diogenes lighted a candle in the daytime, and went round saying,
     "I am looking for a man."
_Diogenes. vi._
     When asked what he would take to let a man give him a blow on the
     head, he said, "A helmet."
_Diogenes. vi._
     Once he saw a youth blushing, and addressed him, "Courage, my
     boy! that is the complexion of virtue."
_Diogenes. vi._
     When asked what wine he liked to drink, he replied, "That which

     a very useful thing to save a man from being too late for
     supper."

     I."
_Zeno. xix._
     They say that the first inclination which an animal has is to
     protect itself.
_Zeno. lii._
     One ought to seek out virtue for its own sake, without being
     influenced by fear or hope, or by any external influence.
     Moreover, that in _that_ does happiness consist.
_Zeno. liii._
     The Stoics also teach that God is unity, and that he is called
     Mind and Fate and Jupiter, and by many other names besides.
_Zeno. lxviii._
     They also say that God is an animal immortal, rational, perfect,
     and intellectual in his happiness, unsusceptible of any kind of
     evil, having a foreknowledge of the universe and of all that is
     in the universe; however, that he has not the figure of a man;
     and that he is the creator of the universe, and as it were the
     Father of all things in common, and that a portion of him
     pervades everything.
_Zeno. lxxii._
     But Chrysippus, Posidonius, Zeno, and Boëthus say, that all
     things are produced by fate. And fate is a connected cause of
     existing things, or the reason according to which the world is
     regulated.
_Zeno. lxxiv._
     Apollodorus says, "If any one were to take away from the books of
     Chrysippus all the passages which he quotes from other authors,
     his paper would be left empty."
_Chrysippus. iii._
     One of the sophisms of Chrysippus was, "If you have not lost a
     thing, you have it."
_Chrysippus. xi._
     Pythagoras used to say that he had received as a gift from
     Mercury the perpetual transmigration of his soul, so that it was
     constantly transmigrating and passing into all sorts of plants or
     animals.
_Pythagoras. iv._
     He calls drunkenness an expression identical with ruin.
_Pythagoras. vi._

     thy heart.
_Pythagoras. xvii._
     In the time of Pythagoras that proverbial phrase "Ipse
     dixit"[765-3] was introduced into ordinary life.

     Xenophanes was the first person who asserted . . . that the soul
     is a spirit.
_Xenophanes. iii._
     It takes a wise man to discover a wise man.

     exactly opposite to each other.

    And no man knows distinctly anything,
    And no man ever will.

     down."
_Pyrrho. viii._
     Euripides  says,
    Who knows but that this life is really death,
    And whether death is not what men call life?
_Pyrrho. viii._
     The mountains, too, at a distance appear airy masses and smooth,
     but seen near at hand, they are rough.
_Pyrrho. ix._
     If appearances are deceitful, then they do not deserve any
     confidence when they assert what appears to them to be true.
_Pyrrho. xi._
     The chief good is the suspension of the judgment, which
     tranquillity of mind follows like its shadow.
_Pyrrho. xi._
     Epicurus laid down the doctrine that pleasure was the chief good.
_Epicurus. vi._
     He alludes to the appearance of a face in the orb of the moon.

ATHENÆUS. _Circa_ 200 A. D.
(_Translation by C. D. Yonge, B. A._)
     It was a saying of Demetrius Phalereus, that "Men having often
     abandoned what was visible for the sake of what was uncertain,
     have not got what they expected, and have lost what they
     had,--being unfortunate by an enigmatical sort of
     calamity."
_The Deipnosophists. vi. 23._
     Every investigation which is guided by principles of Nature fixes
     its ultimate aim entirely on gratifying the stomach.
_The Deipnosophists. vii. 11._
     Dorion, ridiculing the description of a tempest in the "Nautilus"
     of Timotheus, said that he had seen a more formidable storm in a
     boiling saucepan.
_The Deipnosophists. viii. 19._
     On one occasion some one put a very little wine into a
     wine-cooler, and said that it was sixteen years old. "It is very
     small for its age," said Gnathæna.
_The Deipnosophists. xiii. 47._
     Goodness does not consist in greatness, but greatness in
     goodness.
_The Deipnosophists. xiv. 46._
SAINT AUGUSTINE. 354-430.
     When I am here, I do not fast on Saturday; when at Rome, I do
     fast on Saturday.
_Epistle 36. To Casulanus._
     The spiritual virtue of a sacrament is like light,--although it
     passes among the impure, it is not polluted.
_Works. Vol. iii. In Johannis Evangelum, c. tr. 5, Sect. 15._
ALI BEN ABI TALEB.[767-6] ---- -660.
    Believe me, a thousand friends suffice thee not;
    In a single enemy thou hast more than enough.
OMAR KHAYYÁM. ---- -1123.
(_Translated by Edward Fitzgerald._)
    I sometimes think that never blows so red
    The Rose as where some buried Cæsar bled;
      That every Hyacinth the Garden wears
    Dropt in her Lap from some once lovely Head.
_Rubáiyát. Stanza xix._
    A Moment's Halt--a momentary taste
    Of BEING from the Well amid the Waste
      And, Lo! the phantom Caravan has reach'd
    The NOTHING it set out from. Oh, make haste!

    Moves on; nor all your Piety nor Wit
      Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
    Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.
_Rubáiyát. Stanza lxxi._
    And this I know: whether the one True Light
    Kindle to Love, or Wrath-consume me quite,
      One Flash of It within the Tavern caught
    Better than in the Temple lost outright.
_Rubáiyát. Stanza lxxvii._
    And when like her, O Sáki, you shall pass
    Among the Guests Star-scatter'd on the Grass,
      And in your blissful errand reach the spot

    The more the marble wastes,
    The more the statue grows.
_Sonnet._

     For where God built a church, there the Devil would also build a
     chapel.

     his last will: "I owe much; I have nothing; I give the rest to
     the poor."
_Motteux's Life._
    One inch of joy surmounts of grief a span,
    Because to laugh is proper to the man.

MICHAEL DE MONTAIGNE. 1533-1592.
(_Works._[774-1] _Cotton's translation, revised by Hazlitt and Wight._)
     Man in sooth is a marvellous, vain, fickle, and unstable
     subject.
_Book i. Chap. i. That Men by various Ways arrive at the same End._
     All passions that suffer themselves to be relished and digested
     are but moderate.
_Book i. Chap. ii. Of Sorrow._
     It is not without good reason said, that he who has not a good
     memory should never take upon him the trade of lying.

_Book i. Chap. xxv. Of the Education of Children._
     We were halves throughout, and to that degree that methinks by

_Book i. Chap. xxvii. Of Friendship._
     There are some defeats more triumphant than victories.
_Book i. Chap. xxx. Of Cannibals._
     Nothing is so firmly believed as what we least know.

_Book ii. Chap. viii. Of the Affection of Fathers._
     The middle sort of historians (of which the most part are) spoil

     The only good histories are those that have been written by the

_Book ii. Chap. x. Of Books._
     She [virtue] requires a rough and stormy passage; she will have
     either outward difficulties to wrestle with,[775-5] . . . or

     There is, nevertheless, a certain respect and a general duty of
     humanity that ties us, not only to beasts that have life and
     sense, but even to trees and plants.
_Book ii. Chap. xi. Of Cruelty._
     Some impose upon the world that they believe that which they do
     not; others, more in number, make themselves believe that they

_Book ii. Chap. xii. Apology for Raimond Sebond._
     When I play with my cat, who knows whether I do not make her more

_Book ii. Chap. xii. Apology for Raimond Sebond._
     'T is one and the same Nature that rolls on her course, and
     whoever has sufficiently considered the present state of things
     might certainly conclude as to both the future and the
     past.
_Book ii. Chap. xii. Apology for Raimond Sebond._
     The souls of emperors and cobblers are cast in the same mould. .
     . . The same reason that makes us wrangle with a neighbour causes
     a war betwixt princes.
_Book ii. Chap. xii. Apology for Raimond Sebond._
     Man is certainly stark mad; he cannot make a worm, and yet he
     will be making gods by dozens.
_Book ii. Chap. xii. Apology for Raimond Sebond._
     Why may not a goose say thus: "All the parts of the universe I
     have an interest in: the earth serves me to walk upon, the sun to
     light me; the stars have their influence upon me; I have such an
     advantage by the winds and such by the waters; there is nothing
     that yon heavenly roof looks upon so favourably as me. I am the
     darling of Nature! Is it not man that keeps and serves
     me?"
_Book ii. Chap. xii. Apology for Raimond Sebond._
     Arts and sciences are not cast in a mould, but are formed and

     Saying is one thing, doing another.
_Book ii. Chap. xxxi. Of Anger._
     Is it not a noble farce, wherein kings, republics, and emperors
     have for so many ages played their parts, and to which the whole
     vast universe serves for a theatre?
_Book ii. Chap. xxxvi. Of the most Excellent Men._
     Nature forms us for ourselves, not for others; to be, not to
     seem.
_Book ii. Chap. xxxvii. Of the Resemblance of Children to their
Brothers._
     There never was in the world two opinions alike, no more than two
     hairs or two grains; the most universal quality is
     diversity.

     The public weal requires that men should betray and lie and
     massacre.

     Few men have been admired by their own domestics.

     and those within despair of getting out.
_Book iii. Chap. v. Upon some Verses of Virgil._
     And to bring in a new word by the head and shoulders, they leave
     out the old one.
_Book iii. Chap. v. Upon some Verses of Virgil._
     All the world knows me in my book, and my book in me.
_Book iii. Chap. v. Upon some Verses of Virgil._
     'T is so much to be a king, that he only is so by being so. The
     strange lustre that surrounds him conceals and shrouds him from
     us; our sight is there broken and dissipated, being stopped and
     filled by the prevailing light.
_Book iii. Chap. vii. Of the Inconveniences of Greatness._
     We are born to inquire after truth; it belongs to a greater power
     to possess it. It is not, as Democritus said, hid in the bottom
     of the deeps, but rather elevated to an infinite height in the
     divine knowledge.
_Book iii. Chap. viii. Of the Art of Conversation._
     I moreover affirm that our wisdom itself, and wisest

     compatriots.

     My appetite comes to me while eating.
_Book iii. Chap. ix. Of Vanity._
     There is no man so good, who, were he to submit all his thoughts
     and actions to the laws, would not deserve hanging ten times in
     his life.
_Book iii. Chap. ix. Of Vanity._
     Saturninus said, "Comrades, you have lost a good captain to make
     him an ill general."
_Book iii. Chap. ix. Of Vanity._
     A little folly is desirable in him that will not be guilty of
     stupidity.

     Habit is a second nature.
_Book iii. Chap. x._
     We seek and offer ourselves to be gulled.

     Amongst so many borrowed things, I am glad if I can steal one,
     disguising and altering it for some new service.
_Book iii. Chap. xii. Of Physiognomy._
     I am further of opinion that it would be better for us to have
     [no laws] at all than to have them in so prodigious numbers as we
     have.
_Book iii. Chap. xiii. Of Experience._

FRANCIS, DUC DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULD. 1613-1680.
(_Reflections, or Sentences and Moral Maxims._)
     Our virtues are most frequently but vices disguised.
     We have all sufficient strength to endure the misfortunes of
     others.
_Maxim 19._
     Philosophy triumphs easily over past evils and future evils; but
     present evils triumph over it.
_Maxim 22._
     We need greater virtues to sustain good than evil fortune.
_Maxim 25._
     Neither the sun nor death can be looked at with a steady eye.
_Maxim 26._
     Interest speaks all sorts of tongues, and plays all sorts of
     parts, even that of disinterestedness.
_Maxim 39._
     We are never so happy or so unhappy as we suppose.
_Maxim 49._
     There are few people who would not be ashamed of being loved when
     they love no longer.
_Maxim 71._
     True love is like ghosts, which everybody talks about and few
     have seen.
_Maxim 76._
     The love of justice is simply, in the majority of men, the fear
     of suffering injustice.
_Maxim 78._
     Silence is the best resolve for him who distrusts himself.
_Maxim 79._
     Friendship is only a reciprocal conciliation of interests, and an
     exchange of good offices; it is a species of commerce out of
     which self-love always expects to gain something.
_Maxim 83._
     A man who is ungrateful is often less to blame than his
     benefactor.

     others.

     Too great haste to repay an obligation is a kind of ingratitude.
_Maxim 226._
     There is great ability in knowing how to conceal one's ability.
_Maxim 245._
     The pleasure of love is in loving. We are happier in the passion
     we feel than in that we inspire.
_Maxim 259._
     We always like those who admire us; we do not always like those
     whom we admire.
_Maxim 294._
     The gratitude of most men is but a secret desire of receiving
     greater benefits.
